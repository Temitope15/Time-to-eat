    title: "Making Peace With The Enemy.",
    content: [
      `I don't live a life of warfare because of the wisdom from the scripture that holy spirit taught me which I will be sharing in this diary.`,
      `It is wisdom of how to make peace with the enemy, this was the wisdom present in Solomon but was missing in David that made the life of David full of battle and made the life of Solomon to be free from battle.`,
      `1 Chronicles 22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. Look at what Solomon himself said about his father david;`,
      `1 Kings 5:3 You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the Lord his God because of the wars which were fought against him on every side, until the Lord put his foes under the soles of his feet.`,
      `1 Kings 5:4 But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence.
        The question is what is the wisdom behind a battle free life? It is the wisdom of learning how to make peace with your enemy.
        And we see Jesus giving this as a code in Luke 14:31 but many could not decode it. `,
      `Luke 14:31-32
        [31]“Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10,000 could defeat the 20,000 soldiers marching against him?
        [32]And if he can’t, he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away.`,
      `I don't know the interpretation you may give to this scripture, but there a deep revelational wisdom that Holy ghost taught me from it that is working for me.
        Many thought everything you do with the enemy is to make war with him, but many didn't know that there is wisdom in the Spirit to make peace with the enemy.`,
      `Get this mystery, every enemy you see in life that is still powerful attacking believers, the plan of God is for us to make peace with them and not make war with them.
        While the enemy that needed warfare which doesn't understand the language of peace are the enemy that Christ has come to deal with for us, those enemies you can't fight them, God himself have come down as Christ and fought them for us.`,
      `And he told us clearly in his word that over those enemy we are to hold our peace because he will fight for us.
        Exodus 14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
        He didn't say you should fight for yourself, he didn't say I will empower you to fight for yourself,  but he said I, God will fight for you, all you need to do is to fold your arms and enter your peace and rest.`,
      `He gave this as prophecy in Exodus and we see it coming to pass by Christ when God came as flesh to fight that enemy for us.
        Such enemies are called principalities, the scripture says Christ has put them in public shame for us.
        Colossians 2:15
        And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
        Every other enemy remaining, we are to make peace with them, that is why our weapons of warfare is not power, but wisdom, even the sword of the spirit is not fire, it is the word of God 
        God never told us to wrestle with demon or go in warfare with demon, he only told us to cast him out in the life of those not born again who are demon possessed, but if demon himself is coming for you, facing and fighting them will cause you many unrest in life, there are hidden wisdom available for us to make peace with demon .( just open your mind and be following).
        Have you come across scripture that define wisdom as the greatest weapon of warfare?
        Ecclesiastes 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war;`,
      `Ecclesiastes 9:18(NLT)
        [18]Better to have wisdom than weapons of war, 
        What is God saying to us in this scripture that we don't pay due attention to?
        To you power should be the greatest weapon of warfare,  so you are busy crying for power, but God is saying better to have wisdom than all weapon of warfare. 
        When you hold wisdom in your hand as weapon of warfare, it is not to attack the enemy but to make peace with the enemy so as to let you go. Have you observed that in most cases if God gives you power, it is to solve people's problems minus your own problems?`,
      `Go back to the book of God's generals and see how mighty men fell at the feet of the enemy with their power, due to some decision not guided with wisdom that they took, 
        have you observed that highest percentage of the books of God's generals never ended well, many of us only read their miraculous story but we never paid attention to their ending. 
        For David, God taught his hands to war and that is the picture of Christ but for Solomon, God taught him to make peace with the enemy and that is the picture of the church.
        That is why the scripture keep on calling us more than a conqueror but yet we cannot understand the meaning.`,
      `Romans 8:37
        Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
        We still carry the mentality of warfare, which is fighting to conquer, but the scripture keep on calling us more than conquerors.
        A conqueror is the person that fight his enemy and win by power.
        While more than conqueror is the person that have the skills and wisdom to settle with his enemy and they are living in peace, God now begin to prepare a table before him in the presence of his enemy. `,
      `God's plan is for the wheat and the tares to grow together,  but we want to be separating them and fighting the tares.( Mathew 13:25:30)
        I don't know the enemy you have, be it the enemy of your health which is sickness, enemy of your finance which is poverty, enemy of your progress which is stagnation, enemy of your rest which is frustration, all these enemies are spirit, there are wisdom in the spirit that can make you to make peace with them, and they will effortlessly leave you alone permanently. `,
      `Infact, God is taking something relating to this for us in the scripture but we aren't getting the code, he said I will make your enemy to be at peace with you.
        Proverbs 16:7 When a man’s ways please the Lord,
        He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
        He didn't say I will kill your enemy for you, he didn't say I will fight your enemy for you, but he said I will make them to be at peace with you.`,
      `Take note of these two scriptures;`,
      `1. Proverbs 16:7 where God said I will make your enemy to be at peace with you. 
        2. Exodus 14:14 where God is saying I will fight for you.
        There are two enemy we must pay attention to that we have. 
        The first one is the enemy that God came to fight for us.
        The second enemy God didn't come to fight them for us, he came to make them to be at peace with us.
        There are enemy that God fight for us, and we see Jesus coming to deal with that, any enemy you are fighting now, it is a lack of your revelational knowledge of your position in Christ.
        While the second enemy, God didn't deal with them at the cross, they are the enemy the scripture talk about when he told Jesus "sit at my right hand until I make all your enemy to be under your foot"`,
      `Matthew 22:44 ‘The Lord said to my Lord,
        “Sit at My right hand,
        Till I make Your enemies Your footstool”’?
        Meaning not all the enemy have been conquered yet.
        Meaning there are some enemy that aren't yet under the feet of Jesus, this enemy, we don't fight them by fire, they don't die by fire, trying to attack them put you more in trouble, that is why many warfare churches never enter their rest, it is battle always and yet those enemies never die, the more they pray and do warfare prayer, the more the enemy wage war against them.`,
      `Have you observed that many of our mothers have been fighting this battle in praying vigil for over 20 years and yet they handed over the same pattern to us and we never questioned it that something is wrong with this warfare prayer.
        What is this battle we are fighting for over 20 years with prayer and yet never solve, is that battle powerful more than the name of Jesus, is God no longer on the throne?
        A wisdom is only missing in us, people are perishing not because they don't pray but because they lack revelational knowledge. `,
      `They don't know that there are two enemy, the first one which Christ has dealt with for us and he has put them in open shame, while the second are the enemy not yet under the foot of jesus and this enemy you dont fight them, you make peace with them.
        Look at the parable Jesus gave on how to handle this kind of enemy.
        Luke 14:31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?`,
      `Luke 14:32 Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.
        Take note of the first bible verse, 
        This is a battle between two kings.
        You are a king, the enemies also are kings.
        And the scripture say when the first king noticed that the weapon of his enemy is more than his own, he quickly sent delegates to his enemy and make peace with him.
        There are enemy that God want you to handle like that.`,
      `I know you are full of fire, but I tell you, calm down, if all your life is full of battle, you can never make progress in life, infact you can't be a tool in building God's church,  such is the case of David.
        If all your life is about battles then where is the place of rest that God promised us ? 
        You can't be wiser than the scripture that say wisdom is better than all weapons of war.
        This scripture is a promise you can claim it, and free yourself from all this warfare mentality,  they are stronghold you need to be free from. `,
      `Can you claim this scripture for yourself and put your name in it ..and see how life in Christ can be full of peace and rest. 
        1 Chronicles 22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be BANJO AYEKA, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.`,
      `The question is how can I make peace with my enemy?
        Let us journey again by tomorrow, it is a 365 days journey in the spirit, you will see how your spiritual life will shift and grow within one year.`,

    title: "Negotiating With The Enemy.",
    content: [
      `Have you sat down to ask yourself how Jesus overcame the enemy for us? By warfare and fighting the devil ? No sir, it was by making peace with the enemy on our behalf.`,
      `That is, they entered into negotiation at the conference house of immortality and ask the devil to name his price for him to release us.`,
      `The scripture says we were bought by the blood of Jesus. `,
      `1 Corinthians 6:20 For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.`,
      `Bought from who and bought by who? Bought from the devil and by Christ.

      If you want to buy something from someone, you don't first determine how much you want to pay, the seller determines how much he want to sell, then because of how much you love what you want to buy or redeem, you then enter into peaceful negotiation with the seller.`,
      `This is what the scripture describes as redemption.

      Redemption means (apolutrósis) and it's a situation whereby Christ purchases us, he ransomed us, with the price of his own life, securing our deliverance from the bondage.`,
      `That word “redeem” is a language of the marketplace in both the Greek and the Roman cultures in Paul’s day.

      The question is who did Jesus bought us from ? Jesus didn't buy us from God, he bought us from the devil, meaning, it wasn't God that demanded the life of Jesus, it was the devil that demanded for the life of Jesus as price before he could release us.`,
      `And  Christ didn't ask devil to die by fire but he paid the price for our release, he never hijacked us from the enemy by his powers through warfare but he released us with his life  through negotiation.

      What is the mystery of negotiating with the enemy that many of us don't understand?
      
      You may ask why did devil demand for Jesus in our place and in exchange of us? it was because devil knows that if he can have Jesus he already have everything.`,
      `Do you remember when he was asking Jesus to bow down for him in exchange of the whole world, they are talking business here, you are busy talking warfare, buying and selling is warfare in the spirit, market place is a battle field, devil mean business here when he was asking Jesus to bow so he'll give Jesus the whole world and it's Glory.`,
      `Luke 4:5 Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.`,
      `Luke 4:6 And the devil said to Him, “All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.`,
      `Luke 4:7 Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours.”`,
      `Because he want Jesus and he prefer to have Jesus under him than having the whole world under him, so he threw his negotiation to Jesus.

      But what Jesus need was not the world and it's glory, there is something in the hand of the devil that Jesus also need, and that is our souls, our souls are in the hand of the devil and Jesus also desire to have it, and Jesus ask him to name his price.`,
      `And he demanded for the life of Jesus in exchange for our life, in his own wisdom he felt once he can have Jesus he have everything, because he knew by Jesus everything both in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible was created, and Jesus surrendered his life to him in exchange of our life.

      You can see peaceful negotiation in the Spirit realm. This is the All-Powerful God, what is God trying to do here that we didn't understand ? this is what Paul referred to as the foolishness of God.`,
      `1 Corinthians 1:25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.`,
      `Because how can you refuse to hijack your people whom you love from the hand of the enemy when you have the power but rather go for negotiation with the enemy. That sound foolish in the realm of man that felt life is by force, but that is wisdom in the realm of God where they know that life is by talk (word).
      Is devil so important like that for God to go on negotiating with him before he released us? Devil is not as important as that.`,
      `But there is a wisdom of warfare that many never understood, all we know is to fight the enemy by facing the enemy, we fight spirit as if we are fighting flesh and blood.

      We get angry at spirit the way we get angry at humans beings, we call it holy anger, and devil keep on laughing at us because he knows that anger rest in the bosom of fools.`,
      `Ecclesiastes 7:9 Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry, For anger rests in the bosom of fools.`,
      `Whenever God want to get angry at his enemy he laughs, that is why the scripture says he that sitted in heavens shall laugh.`,
      `Psalms 2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves,
      And the rulers take counsel together,
      Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying,
      
      Psalms 2:3 “Let us break Their bonds in pieces
      And cast away Their cords from us.”
      
      Psalms 2:4 He who sits in the heavens shall laugh;The Lord shall hold them in derision.`,

      `Take note of verse 4 to see the reaction of God to the enemy.
      "He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision."
      
      The way God expresses anger to spirit which are invisible creature is different from the way God expresses anger to men which are visible creatures.
      
      If you can't fight spirit the way God is fighting them, then you don't understand spiritual warfare yet.`,
      `The highest level of warfare in the spirit is negotiation. A situation whereby you ask the enemy to name the price and give him what he wants.

      Any country who adopt this principle end up becomimg a peaceful nation, it is a law of the spirit.
      
      There was a time the militants were disturbing the south south region of the nation Nigeria, everyone was advising the then president to raise warfare with them, because he is the commander in the chief of Armed forces, but the president was so wise enough to understand the code of the spirit, he called them into negotiation and asked them to name their price and they entered into agreement and that became the end of war. He make peace with the enemy.`,
      `This was also what Christ did with the enemy. 

      The question is why didn't Jesus hijack us from the devil, why does he have to stoop so low to the level of buying when all power and authority to hijack us is in his hands? 
      
      Because our weapon of warfare in the body of Christ today is far from the way Jesus did his own warfare and we claim he is the one we are looking unto as the author and finisher of our faith.`,

      `But we see Jesus negotiating with the devil here asking him to name his price, and giving the devil the cost of the price of our soul.

      I tell you a mystery today that you can negotiate with sickness,  poverty,  backwardness, and they will eternally leave you alone, they will eternally make peace with you, just be following this devotionals.`,
      `The word redeem means to buy back, Jesus didn't enter into the gate of hell and hades to hijack us by warfare, he went on negotiation at the round table to seek for their price, negotiate it with them and trasfer the price to the bank account of the devil and when the devil saw the alert, he released us all. 

      This sound to be downgrading the integrity of the Almighty, negotiating with ordinary so called Satan, but it is a mystery of warfare many doesn't understand, it is not reconciling with the enemy, it is making peace with the enemy for a purpose which you will see as you read this teaching.`,
      `Many of us are fighting like angels who go on warfare with the devil rather than we fighting like Jesus, who goes on negotiations with the devil. 

      This now makes us begin to quote the book of revelation out of context where the scripture says that there was war in heaven, we felt there must also be war on Earth.`,
      `Revelation 12:7 Satan Thrown Out of Heaven
      And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,
      
      Revelation 12:8 but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer.
      Revelation 12:9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.`,
      `There is no wisdom in the method of warfare between the Angel and devil in the heavenly places stated in this scripture, but we don't pay spiritual attention to it.

      The scripture says when an angel prevailed over the devil with warfare, he sent satan to Earth. `,
      `Revelation 12:9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.`,
      `Was it Earth he suppose to cast Satan to or hell? 

      It is like one enemy came to fight you and claim you defeated him but only for you to send him out of your room but send him to the room of the children of your boss, truly you are free but the children of your boss are now in danger. 
      
      You only fought for your life, but never considered the children of your master, such was what Micheal did.`,
      `No one go into warfare with the enemy and not loose something ,truly you may win someone, but you will lose something, there is always side effect of every warfare and many of us didn't know this, and we saw the side effect of the warfare Angel Michael did with the devil here now.

      Angels are servant of God, why we are predestined sons of God, and Micheal in his warfare now sent Satan out of the realm of the servants of God (Angels) and cast him to the realm of we whom God is mindful of.`,
      `Can I call this jealousy, when you know that God is mindful of men.`,
      `Psalms 8:4 What is man that You are mindful of him,And the son of man that You visit him?

      Psalms 8:5 For You have made him a little lower than the angels,
      And You have crowned him with glory and honor.
      
      Psalms 8:6 You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands;
      You have put all things under his feet,`,
      `Why will Angel Micheal cast the devil to Earth rather than casting him to hell, when he knows that Earth is the habitant of the creature that God love most, which is man.

      Our suffering on Earth today now was the negative effect of the victory of Angel Micheal with the devil in the heavenly places. There is no wisdom in such warfare but we didn't know, they now have peace in Heaven because devil is no longer there but woe unto the Earth for devil has been sent to you. `,
      `Revelation 12:12 Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.”`,
      `Why will angel Micheal be so selfish like that, Heaven is not our place, what the scripture says is that the Earth he has given to the children of man, Earth is our habitat.`,
      `Psalms 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s;
      But the Earth He has given to the children of men.`,
      `Infact, after rapture we are not going to Heaven, Heaven is not our home, we are going to a new Earth. `,
      `Revelation 21:1 All Things Made New
      Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea.`,
      `So Earth is what is designed for the children of God and that same Earth is designed to be the habitant of God's children,  the servant of God called Micheal now cast Satan to that same environment of the children of God just because he wanted the environment of the servant of God which are the angels to be peaceful. 

      The sons of God are now in woes, while the servants of God who are the angels are now enjoying.`,
      `NKJV, Revelation 12:12
      Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.”`,
      `That is why Solomon by the help of the Spirit said he has seen something under heaven that the princes who are the sons of God are struggling on earth while the servants who are the angels are riding on chariot of horses.`,
      `Ecclesiastes 10:7 I have seen servants on horses, While princes walk on the ground like servants.`,
      `Each time men in the scripture capture the picture of angels in their vision, you see them on chariots or horses, that is their reality, and they are servants, but many princes of the king which are the children of God are struggling on Earth. 

      Many of us blame Adam that through him, sin entered into the Earth, but we didn't know that the problem was through the warfare method of Angel Micheal who sent Satan to the Earth rather than sending him to hell. `,
      `Truly by Adam sin came into the Earth, but I tell you that by Angel Micheal Satan came into the Earth. 

      Hell was the place God prepared for Satan not Earth, that is why the scripture now said that another angel now come in revelation 20 and cast Satan from Earth to the bottomless pit.`,
      `Revelation 20:1 
      Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
      
      Revelation 20:2 He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;
      
      Revelation 20:3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while.`,
      `If Micheal fought with wisdom, this is what he could have done, that is he could have sent him to hell and not to Earth.

      Someone is saying how will you be talking to a whole angel Micheal like this.`,
      `Please don't think I am trying to be rude to angel Micheal, I am only tapping into the wisdom of the world to come by which we'll posses to judge Angels, because just as we have the power of the world to come so also we have the wisdom of the world to come, and men who can tap into the wisdom of the world to come will understand what I am saying. 

      There are many of the angelic activities that finds expression both in Heaven and on Earth which we have given accolades to which we're going to judge on the last day. The scripture told us clearly that we shall judge angels.`,
      `1 Corinthians 6:3 Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?`,
      `I love the way amplified version puts it.`,
      `1cor 6:3
      3 Do you not know also that we [Christians] are to judge the [very] angels and pronounce opinion between right and wrong [for them]? How much more then [as to] matters pertaining to this world and of this life only!`,
      `The scripture is not talking about falling angels here, it is talking about Holy angels.

      We are not judging falling Angels because they have been judged already, but we are going to judge Holy angels because they are not also perfect in their act and deed, and one of it is what i am revealing now by the wisdom of the world to come.
      
      The scripture say angels are not Holy also in the sight of God `,
      `Job 15
      15 Behold, [God] puts no trust in His holy ones [the angels]; indeed, the heavens are not clean in His sight--( Amplified version)`,
      `Meaning, there are certain act of imperfections Angels are  expressing which many didn't know, the fearful honour we have for them make us to think they are perfect, they are holy but they are not perfect.

      And one of their imperfection  is what I am expressing to you now which Angel Michael did.
      
      We are going to judge the rights and wrongs of Angels.`,
      `We  look at angels with fear  because we don't know our identity and they are also looking at us with fear because they know our identity, they know they are servants of God and they know we are sons of God, they know we're the one that will judge them.

      We see them as servants of God and they see us as the children of their master and their judge.`,
      `They are designed to be mighty in strength than us because of their assignment for us why we are designed to be wiser than them because of our position in Christ.

      That is why the scripture say the manifold wisdom of God is designed to be made known by the church to the angels.`,
      `Ephesians 3:
      10 [The purpose is] that through the church the [c]complicated, many-sided wisdom of God in all its infinite variety and innumerable aspects might now be made known to the angelic rulers and authorities (principalities and powers) in the heavenly sphere.`,
      `I tell you today that men are not the only one reading this teaching, Angels are also reading to learn from it.

      So if I am trying to bring corrections to what Angels did, don't think I am speaking heresy, i know the realm at which i am talking from.
      
      Just saying this for you to know that the method of warfare of Angel Micheal is not given to us by God to copy, we are not to learn from that, it is not a perfect method of warfare, 
      the method through which Christ put captivity into captive and give gift to men is the method we are to follow.`,
      `And that is the principle of negotiations, the principles of making peace with the enemy. 

      Now the question is how can I negotiate with the devil, how can I make peace with the enemy? How can my enemy also be at peace with me? How can I also adopt this wisdom over sickness, poverty, or any of your enemy?
      
      Just be following, at night devotion, you will see the wisdom from the scripture and you will see how a man can be eternally free from battle of life `,

      "We have been using some days now to open a dimension of spiritual reality to us which is the mystery of negotiating with the enemy for peace to reign,  rather than calling for battle for war to reign, because a Christian that his life is full of battle can never make progress in life",

      "The question is , is battle free Christian life posible at all? Yes, because it is part of Gods promise for us",

      "1 Chronicles 22:9",
      "But you will have a son who will be a man of peace. I WILL GIVE HIM PEACE WITH HIS ENEMIES in all the surrounding lands. His name will be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel during his reign",

      "Take note of that scripture,  I will give him peace with all his enemies,  not I will kill all his enemy, but both him and his enemy will be living together in peace, God will be preparing a table before him in the presence of his enemy",

      "Now the question is how can I make peace with the enemy? How can I negotiate with the devil to leave my life alone? Because the wisdom of making peace with the enemy was what make all the enemies of Jerusalem to have peace with Jerusalem in the days of Solomon, that was why he could successfully build the temple of the lord",

      "And we see Jesus also referring to this pertains in the book of luke 14",

      "Luke 14:31-32",
      `Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10,000 could defeat the 20,000 soldiers marching against him?",
"[32] And if he can’t, he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away`,

      "Now the question is how can I discuss the terms and condition of peace while my enemies are still far away",

      "It is very simple, it is by giving to the devil what you have that it is not Christ that gave to you, because every of your things with the devil has been bought back by the blood of the Lamb, so every of his things with you must also must be surrendered back to him",

      "If you enter into the negotiations table with the devil and ask him what does he want in other to leave you alone, the true fact is that all he wants is your life, and what Christ expects from you is to surrender your life back to him because he has  given you a new life, which is eternal life, so let the old life pass away",

      "Can you now understand why the scripture says we overcome him because we are not afraid to lose our life?",

      "Revelation 12:11",
      "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death",

      "The problem of many of us is that we receive a new life by faith and still hold unto our old life in fear, we receive the new life which is eternal life know as the life of christ, but we are afraid to loose our life know as the old life which is the life of the devil in us",

      "God's will is for you to surrender your life to the devil just as Jesus did",

      "We don't surrender our life to Jesus, Jesus doesn't need our life, he came to give us a new life, and all you need to receive that new life is to BELIEVE.( john 3:16)",

      "And you don't surrender your life so that you can receive a new life, you have already received a new life by faith that is why you need to surrender your old life back to the owner in peace, ( Dont find devils trouble)",

      "It is the enemy that is demanding for your life, because the life belong to them and all you do is to give it to him, that is the negotiating price if you can understand what the Spirit is saying",

      "Get this, the new life in you can never be attacked with sickness or poverty, if that new life becomes sick then God is sick, if that new life is poor then God is poor, if God can never be sick and poor then the new life can never be sick and poor",

      "For the devil to still be attacking your financial life  means you still have financial life",

      "For me I don't have any financial life, the life in me now is the life of Christ, so the financial life in me now is the financial life of Christ, I have been crucified with christ, so you can't attacked a crucified life, he is attacked already,  crucification is the highest form of attack",

      "Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me",

      "The scripture says Christ is now my new life",

      "Colossians 3:3 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God",

      "Devil can't kill me, because he has killed me already, it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me",

      "And Christ gave me a new life and the scripture says that new life is hidden in Christ",

      "Colossians 3:3 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God",

      "The devil that will attack this new life doesn't exist, the scripture says it is hidden in Christ, the devil could fight my old life because the life was hidden in me, but the devil can't touch my new life because it is hidden in Christ",

      "Devil is touching your financial life because it is hidden in you, devil can't touch my financial life because it is hidden in christ",

      "And that your financial life, christ doesn't want you to surrender it to him, there is nothing he want to do with it, all you do is to surrender it to the owner and come to Jesus empty and let him give you a new financial life, let him teach you how to save the treasure he blessed you with, called heavenly bank Account where nothing can touch it",

      "Matthew 6:20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal",

      "My own financial life, I have surrendered it to the devil, so as to make peace with him, I can't be fighting financial warfare, so I will rather surrender my financial life to him so as to have the financial life of the Lord. Anything that belongs to the new life is eternally free from any attack while everything that belongs to the old life in you is eternally exposed to the attacks of the enemy",

      "Anything that you have and it is not christ that gives it to you is exposed to attack why everything Christ gives you is free from attack, everything he gives is eternally secured, it is under eternal security",

      "It is when you hijack what God gives to you and makes yourself the owner that you open yourself to attack, but if you make yourself a steward you garrison yourself from attack",

      "If it is YOUR ministry, such a ministry can never be free from attack, but if it is GOD'S ministry in your hand, such a ministry is eternally secured",

      "So if old things have not passed away in your life and if everything has not become new, that aspect that has not passed away and become new is not free from attack, as you are coming out of one warfare over it you will be entering into another warfare over it, until you learn to make peace with the devil by surrendering back to him what belongs to him, your old life doesn't belong to God, it belongs to the devil",

      "Inability to give the devil what he demands is the reason behind many of our warfare",

      "we receive a new life from christ but we have not surrendered our life, and that is why the devil is attacking it",

      "If your enemy is not at peace with you, may you be humble enough to know that it is because your way didn't please God",

      "Because what the word of God said is that if your way pleases the Lord, he will make your enemy to be at peace with you",

      `Proverbs 16:7 When a man’s ways please the Lord,
He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him`,

      "How does Jesus overcome the devil? It is by surrendering his life to the devil to kill it, it is the mystery of negotiations, at the time the devil will come to Jesus, he couldn't find anything in him again because he had surrendered everything to him",

      "John 14:30 I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me",

      "Such is also the pattern you use to overcome the devil, we don't overcome in this kingdom by warfare, we overcome by surrender! Every thing of him that is with us is all he is demanding for, I am not talking about sin, but I am talking about that your good will and good plan you have for yourself that is not God's will and God's plan",

      "If not because we don't look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, is it not the same pattern he overcame the devil that should be the same pattern we are to overcome him? Jesus overcame by surrender",

      "The devil demanded for his life and he gave it to him, and once you believe in Jesus and receive a new life also, the first thing you do is to surrender your old life back to the devil who is the owner, he owns the life so kindly give him back his life. I don't know what you want to be doing with old life and new life together",

      "And I'd you don't surrender them back to him, he will surely come for them, and the act of him coming for his life which he gave to us back  we begin to drag it with him is what we define to be warfare, we now spiritualize it and call it warfare prayer",

      "The question is how do you surrender to the devil?",

      "It is not by looking for the devil about, all you do is just to remove your hand from your life and let him have it, the devil automatically takes your life once you remove your hand from it",

      "Once you remove your hand from your life, devil automatically have it, warfare is when you are dragging your life with him, you are dragging your financial life with him, dragging your marital life with him, dragging your career life with him but can you surrender everything to him, and come to Jesus empty handed so as to receive everything new from him",

      "We win by hands up (Surrender)",

      "How does Jesus surrender his life ? It is by just removing his hands from his life, he was not trying to save his life, when you try to keep it from the enemy you loose it to the enemy, but when you loose it, you have a new one back",

      "Once you surrender your life, and he comes for it, all you do is to turn to Jesus to receive a new life and follow the way of that new life",

      "Because once you receive new life, then you must begin to learn a new way of everything",

      "For instance, your old life have a way of prospering in life which is by seeking what he need and running after what he need",

      "But in this new life now, you must begin to learn the new way, which is by seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness every other things shall be added",

      "The old life is a way of sense and sight, but the new life is a way of Faith and scripture, in the new life you see through the lens of the scripture",

      "With the old life, you see through the lens of the WORLD and follow what the WORLD says but with the new life, you see with the lens of the WORD and follow what the WORD say",

      `You will understand this the day you know that spiritual realm is govern by covenant, that is why we have old covenant and new covenant 
which is agreement, and the new covenant is for the new life`,

      `That realm is not a natural realm where they breach covenant, if you understand what devil demand to make peace with you and you give it to him, he can never and never touch your life again, he understand covenant`,

      "And the covenant is that everything that is yours has been bought from him by the blood of the lamb and everything that is his own in you which is your life, your plan, your ambition, your will, your want , your desire, must be surrendered back to him",

      "And then pick up the new life , new plan, new will, New way that Christ has set before you, and you see God making your enemy to be at peace with you",

      "Many of us didn't know that what comprises the old life is not only evil life, the tree we ate is not the tree of evil, it is tree of good and evil, meaning the old life have two fruit, which is the fruit of good and evil",

      "And what many of us did was that we do away with the evil fruit of the old life and maintain the good fruit of the old life, and we called it morality, we call it good way and that is what every religion including Christian religion preaches,  and that is not true christianity",

      "But when you are ready to walk with Jesus, you will surrender that good fruit to follow God's fruit",

      "There is one thing to deny what is evil and follow what is good, that is morality, and the society love you for that, while there is another thing to deny what is good and follow what is God and that is spirituality and society reject you for that and called you fool",

      "So whenever you surrender the evil ways and follow good ways you see devil coming after that good ways, you will now begin to think why is evil happen to good people?",

      "That your way pleases society doesn't mean it pleases the lord",

      "There is nothing bad going out of the country to the USA, to some it may be God's will,  but to you, it may only be good will but not God's will",

      "And once it is good but not God's will, you see the devil coming after it, you now see everything working against you at embassy, You now begin to move from one prayer mountain seeking for breakthrough",

      `The question is , is it God's will "for you? If yes just enter your rest, because if anything is God's will, the devil that will stop it doesn't exist, if it is God's will, God automatically makes all your enemy to be at peace over it. If it is God's will, God will be for you, and if God is for you, who can be against you over that visa, job opportunities or contract`,

      "Jesus said I set before you an open door , no man or devil can shut it",

      "Revelation 3:8 “I know your works. See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it",

      "If the devil shut the door of USA against you, then it is not God that open the door for you, you only want to open it yourself, and once it is your self and your will, you will have devil to contend with",

      "If God is for you who will be against you?",

      "And God can't be for you, If you are talking a step not according to his will, that a plan is good, legit and moral  doesn't mean it is Gods will for you",

      "So when you see devil againsting you in anything just know God is not for you in that things, and God is not for you because it is not his will for you that time",

      "You must understand the difference between Gods will for you in life and Gods will for you per  time",

      "It is Gods will for you to have a car in life, but it may not be Gods will for you to have it now, and if you want to force yourself to have it now, you will have devil to contend with, you may buy it by your selfish force and have accident with it",

      "God doesn't take control of what you do according to your will,  he only take control of what you do according to his will",

      "So once you begin to notice any attack over any aspect of your life, just know that there is something that is of the devil with you, just go into negotiations with him and give him back what he needs",

      "To some it may just be your will, truly it may good will, but devil is demanding for it, so give it to him, and face the will of God for you, no devil can touch anything that is Gods will",

      "Give him back the visa, just surrender that your USA plan , and wait for God's time, if it is God's will for you to be in the USA, you will surely be their at God's time",

      "You can't use warfare prayer to go your ways,  it is only when you pray according to his will that is when he hears you",

      "That is why the best prayer is God let your will be done",

      "When Jesus was seeking his way, he prayed for hours and sweat came out of his body like blood and yet God never answered him, for you to know that it is not by gymnastic prayers,  but when Jesus just said let your will be done, he never spent a minute again, he stood up",

      "Meaning, Jesus was using hours to pray wrong prayer and God never heard him then he used a minute to pray right prayer and the  heaven opened",

      "But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered."`,

      "The first is that the Righteous shall live by FAITH.( Romans 1:17)",

      "And the Second is that the Righteous shall be delivered through KNOWLEDGE.( Proverbs 11:9)",

      "Ask me why do many righteous got frustrated and confused in life? I will tell you that the answer is because they are trying to live by sight, principles and fact, whereas, they have been ordained by God to live by Faith",

      "Ask me why are many righteous in captive and yet with all their prayers it look as if nothing is working for them, I will tell you that the answer is because the righteous are trying to obtain deliverance by fasting, prayer and power when they have been ordained to be delivered through knowledge.(Light)",

      "Look at the scripture again",

      "Proverbs 11:9",
      "But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered.",

      "Meaning, whenever deliverance is coming to them, the channel through which the deliverance will come is knowledge.",

      "There is one thing to know the source through which your solution will come, and there is another thing to know the channel through which it will come, once you are righteous the sources of your solution is God, and the channel is knowledge, that is why a righteous can remain in captivity with all his fasting and prayer because of lack of knowledge, and the scripture cannot broken.",

      "Rather than breaking the scripture and go free, the scripture will rather break you to make you free.",

      "The moment you are righteous, just know that your deliverance has been ordained to come through knowledge, infact knowledge become the channel through which all that is available for you will be available in you",

      "2 Peter 1:3 as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, THROUGH THE KNOWLEDGE of Him who called us by glory and virtue",

      "The scripture say the divine power of God has given us everything we need. Then the question is how do we get it into our life? It is through knowledge",

      "Faith is like the currency you used to buy what you need in the market of the spirit, why revelational knowledge is like the truck through which you pack those thing you got by faith into your house.",

      "Revelational knowledge is a channel through which spiritual blessing that is available for you is now available in you.",

      `From God, means the SOURCE 
      By faith in Christ means the TOOLS, Through knowledge means the CHANNEL`,

      ` If you get any deliverance in life and it doesn't come through knowledge, then you are not righteous.`,

      "For the righteous, it is what you know that is designed to set you free from anything, not what you do.",

      "What you do only PREVENT you from problem but never DELIVER you from problem, but what you know is what deliver you from problem, that is, your deliverance is designed to come by revelational knowledge, by light of the scripture.",

      "The scripture didn't say you shall DO the truth and the truth you do shall set you free, but you shall KNOW the truth. Truth is not something you do, it is someone you know, and the person you know is Christ, i didn't mean Jesus that died for you, I mean Christ, and who is Christ? He is light, each time you capture any light from the scripture, the light you caught is Christ, Christ is not a person with flesh and blood, he is light of the world.",

      "There is something called the power of darkness.",

      "Colossians 1:13 He has delivered us from the POWER OF DARKNESS and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.",

      "Meaning, if there is power of darkness, there will be power of light.",

      "Many of us only know the power of the Holy Ghost but we don't know the power of light.",

      "The power of light come through revelation of the word of God, that you can have any sickness in your body and a scripture appears to you that by his stripes you are healed, and based on that revelation, the sickness in your body disappears, what you just experienced is called the power of light.",

      "The power of the Holy Ghost comes through a man of God to you, while the power of light come through the word of God to you.",

      "And many of us only run after the men of God that come with the power of God to you, and never follow men of God that come with the word of God to you, it is a sign that you are a baby Christian.",

      "Because there are two things that the Holy Ghost  sent to us and deliver us from our destruction.",

      `1. He sent his men to heal us "and deliver us"`,

      "2 He also sent his word and delivered us.",

      `Psalms 107:20 He sent His word and healed them,
      And delivered them from their destructions.`,

      "That is, by the power of light from the word, you can be free from any problem.",

      "Just as you can be healed and delivered from your destruction by the power of the Holy Ghost through a man of God sent by God, so also you can be healed from your sickness and delivered from your destruction by the light of the Holy Ghost through the word",

      "From my observation I discovered that the church is more familiar with the power of the Holy Ghost, but we are not familiar with the light of the Holy Ghost.",

      "And many of us didn't know that the righteous have only been ordained to be delivered by the light (revelational knowledge) of the Holy Ghost.",

      "The same lord that is the word is also the Spirit, if he is coming as light he come as the word, why if he is coming as fire he come as Spirit.",

      "That is why we have two different men of God raised by God into the body or Christ.",

      "It is either God sends you with the POWER of the Holy Spirit, or God sends you with the LIGHT of the Holy Ghost.",

      "The two can accomplish same result but to different people.",

      "I tell you clearly today that if you get any deliverance by the power of God, that is a pure evidence that you are not righteous and may you be humble enough to accept this.",

      "I didn't mean moral righteousness, what I mean is that you have not obtained the gift of righteousness that comes by Faith, you are still under the law where you think justification is by moral righteousness.",

      "Romans 4:3 For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.",

      "Get this and get this, once you are under Faith and Grace, your deliverance doesn't come through power it come through knowledge (revelational light) it comes through the light of the Holy Ghost.",

      "But for those under the law, or those in the world the instrument through which God meet their deliverance is through power of God.",

      "Once you are born again and you have come to the revelational knowledge that righteousness only come by Faith, heaven will declares you righteous by Faith not by law, and I beseech you to begin to learn to do business with light, because there is something called the power of light, and that same power can produce result as the power of the Holy Spirit.",

      "If you are sick in your body and you are moving from healing crusade about, you will not get any healing, everyone will be healed expect you, because those that heaven has declared righteous are not designed to get their healing through that pattern, you get your healing by light from the word of God, because what God has sent to heal you is not men of God but word of God.",

      "For those still under the law (the self righteous people) and in the world (the unrighteous people) God in his mercy sent men to heal them and deliver them from their destruction,  but for the saint, who have been declared righteous and have been justified by Faith God sent his word to heal them.",

      "Can you see why even though the scripture say by his stripes you are healed and yet you still have sickness in your body, it is because instead of you to be seeking for light, you are seeking for prayer mountain.",

      "Do you ever see the Apostles doing any deliverance in the church or doing any healing in the gathering of the saint? They did all their miracles in the streets for those who are yet to come to faith, his shadows was healing people in the streets not in the church.",

      "Do you ever notice that Jesus never did any miracle or healing for his deciples, theological research make us to understand that james was sick in his body even as a deciples of Jesus, the sickness in his body was what brought his teaching in james 1 vs 2",

      My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials`,

      `But Jesus heal the sick and raised the death by the power of the holy ghost but he never use the same power to heal the sickness in the body of James, it is because the moment you are righteous your deliverance is designed to come by light( revelational knowledge)`,

      "The knowledge that comes from the tree of life which is the knowledge that make you to know what you have that you didn't know, because when God created you, he had already put everything you need to survive inside you and around you, there is a treasure in your earthly vessel.",

      "But once you begin to feed on wrong knowledge which is the knowledge of good and evil it will begin to open your eyes to what you need that you don't have, you will just keep on discovering that you are naked.",

      "And our academic school curriculum, life philosophies and ideologies is full of this dead knowledge.",

      "And that is the reason why we'll graduate with good result but can't do anything with that result than to be looking for who will employ us.",

      "Because all we want to learn in school is about how to get what you need that you didn't have, and this is what led many of us to run a rat race in life.",

      "True knowledge is the knowledge that open your eyes to see yourself, see what you have WITH you that you don't know and see what you have IN you that you don't know.",

      "I don't need to think that until i go out of the country before I will succeed, because everything I need to succeed is within me and is around me.",

      "Lack of true knowledge is just the inability to know what is in me and what is with me to get what I need in life.",

      "You are where you are not because of what you lack, you are where you are because you don't know WHAT you have. (lack of true knowledge)",

      "You are where you are not because of what you lack, you are where you are because you don't know HOW to use what you have. (lack of wisdom)",

      "Show me a seminar and conference that will open your eyes to what is IN you and WITH you, that you didn't know, then I'll show you a seminar that has just impacted you with true knowledge and wisdom that is true.",

      "True knowledge open you up to the resources available that you don't know and not resources needed that you don't have, because everything needed to solve your problems is not far from you.",

      "What you lack is not what keep you where you are, what you have that you didn't know is what keep you where you are.",

      "True light is the knowledge that open your eyes to what you have and didn't know.",

      "False light called darkness is the knowledge that open your eyes to what you lack that you didn't know, this is what Adam ate that brought problems to his life.",

      "You assumed, if i can just see #500,000 (five hundred thousand naira), my business will boom, who told you that money is what you need to grow business?",

       is what God used to create the Heaven and Earth.",

      "When God give you his Word and his Spirit, all he is telling you is to create all you need with it, that is the spiritual raw material God use to create the Heaven and Earth.",

      "The scripture say all things where made by the word.",

      "John 1:1-3 (NET)",
      "1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was fully God.",

      "2. The Word was with God in the beginning.",

      "3. All things were created by him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.",

      "And yet you have what God use to create Heaven and Earth and you can't use it to grow your business.",

      "No business grow by money, business grow by spirit, it grows by being sponsored by the agency of the spirit ask the children of darkness they know this truth.",

      "It is foolish people that attend seminar in the public places on how to grow business,  men who know the truth know how to attend seminar at the conference house of immortality to get Spirit code for their business.",

      "Let me show you a scripture.",

      "Hebrews 11:3",
      "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.",

      "This scripture say all thing that is visible was made by what is not visible.",

      "The secret behind any success in the visible realm is invisible.",

      "If you ask Dangote the secret of his visible success and he begin to point you to the visible things he did, he has not told you the truth.",

      "Because the scripture say all things that are visible are made by what is not visible.",

      "And that thing that is not visible that God use to create the Heaven and the Earth is already with and in you, His Spirit is IN you and his word (scripture) is WITH you.",

      "Meaning, the Word is no longer with God, the raw material needed to create all what you are asking God for is no longer with God, you can see why God cannot answer your prayer again,  the last time God answered the prayer of man was over 2000 years ago at Pentecost, because God has answered all the prayer of man before we will pray.",

      `Isaiah 65:24 “It shall come to pass That before they call, I will answer, And while they are still speaking, I will hear."`,

      "This scripture has been fulfilled, yet many didn't know, God is no longer in the business of you waiting for him to ask before he answer, in the realm of sonship, God answered before you ask.",

      "It wasn't Adam asking God  for wife before God gave him a wife, God made provision for wife before he thought of needing one. Get this, your provision is older than you, you have the solution to your problem with you before having the problems in you.",

      "If the Word was with God, but no longer with God, The question is where is now the Word? Where is now this spiritual raw material? The scripture say it is with you, the Word is now in your mouth, the spiritual raw material to create all things is now with you.",

      "Romans 10:8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith which we preach):",

      "That is the WORD was with God (john 1:1) but the word is now with you (Roman's 10:8)",

      "And yet ignorance is still making us to cry to God to do for us what he has giving us the raw material to create things for ourselves, permit me to tell you that God is helpless over your situation, because he has given you everything to help you already.",

      "Christians are like a nation blessed with crude oil and yet crying to God for petrol, all they need is wisdom on how to get petrol from crude oil, can you now see the reason why scripture told us that wisdom is the principal thing and with all thy getting get understanding,  because wisdom is all you need to discover what is available for you and how to bring out what you need from what God has made available for you.",

      "The simple problem of many of us is how to use this spiritual raw material to form all we need, the scripture say every thing visible was formed by this invisible raw material called the Word of God.",

      "Hebrews 11:3 By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.",

      "How can God bless you with what he use to frame the world and yet you are still the slave of the world.",

      "The children of darkness are blessed with the things of this world, we are now envying them, not knowing God has already blessed us with what he use to create the world, they have what the world produces called the things of this world, but we have what produces the world called the Word of God.",

      "But they look fortunate and we look unfortunate because we lack the knowledge of what God has blessed us with, we also lack the knowledge of how to get what we need from it.",

      "3. Spiritual Blessings",

      "The natural blessings are the natural resources and natural raw materials created for man by God, like the sun, water, Air, land, soil, crude oil among others.",

      "The material blessings are the good things of life created from natural blessing like car, houses, and many good things of this life.",

      "Why spiritual blessings are the spiritual raw materials God used to create Heaven and Earth.",

      "God didn't say i have blessed the Church with all materials blessing and natural blessings,  you don't need to be born again to have access to those blessing, God designed natural blessing (rain) to fall upon the roof of the righteous and the unrighteous.",

      "You don't need to be born again to have access to natural and material blessing, you only need to be born on Earth.",

      "But to get spiritual blessing that is in heavenly places you must be born again.",

      "You may now use the word to create healing for yourself and even create divine health for yourself.",

      "Can you now understand why God keep on saying he has sent his word to heal us, and to deliver us from our destruction.",

      "Because before the Word of God will begin to work for you, the Word of God with you must be in you.",

      "It doesn't take time for the Spirit of God to be in you, once you believe in Jesus and you receive eternal life, you have already received Holy Spirit, but it take time to get the Word of God with you to be in you.",

      "Because the first thing is that you must be loaded with the knowledge of the Word of God and for this purpose God raised teachers in the body of Christ so that they can help you take the Word of God with you (Scripture) and put it in you.",

      "The word of God is powerless once it is with you, but it become the most powerful raw material once it is in you.",

      "The moment you receive eternal life, and you receive eternal Spirit, all you need next is eternal light, once you got a light from the scripture by the help of the Holy Spirit  you have laid hold of the spiritual raw material needed to create what you need.",

      "Meaning in this kingdom what we have is an outcome of what we say,",

      "In the natural realm, what you have is an outcome of what you do, But in the spiritual realm where you belong, what you have is an outcome of what you say.",

      "It doesn't take time for men to confess, but to get the light in men , and that is the issue.",

      "Get this, If your confession is not a product of light, it is as empty as anything, but if your  confession is a product of light it is as powerful more than anything you can imagine.",

      "Get this, don't confess until you have secure a light, confession not sponsored by light is just mere religion.",

      "Christianity is not positive confession, positive confession without revelational light from the scripture can land you into confusions.",

      "Many of us will pray and be expecting things to happen, when God expect you to pray so that light can come and with that light you speak and then something happen.",

      "The scripture say if you have Faith like the mustard seed you can say to this mountain, not pray to God about this mountain, the strength of believer in this Earth is not praying, it is speaking.",

      "So the principalities that God brought your way to educate, they have already put you in bondage because you lack the light needed to educate them, so they are the one educating you now on how powerful they are, that is why all your teachings as a pastor is how devil has dealt with your life, you are now teaching people how powerful devil can be and you begin to put fear in them to pray very well and fast very well if they want to overcome warfare.",

      "The scripture didn't say at the mention of the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, he said in the Name of Jesus, every knee shal bow.(They are two different things)",

      "The Name of Jesus is not something you mention, it is something you enter, that name is a strong tower, the righteous enter into it and is safe.",

      "Freedom is all you need from the bondage of sickness, and the scripture say anywhere there the spirit of the lord is, there is liberty.",

      "Meaning when God was given you holy spirit He was given you liberty, so you have freedom, but because you didn't know, you are not free.",

      "If you know this by revelation, you will confess your freedom from sickness,poverty, lack, stagnation and you will have what you say.",

The race is not to the swift,
Nor the battle to the strong,
Nor bread to the wise,
Nor riches to men of understanding, Nor favor to men of skill; But time and chance happen to them all.`,

      "The scripture say clearly that it is the blessing of the lord that make one rich, without adding sorrow to it. Principles doesn't make anyone wealthy, it is power to make wealth that make one wealthy, and that power is not principles, the power is Spirit.",

      "The poor did not need seven keys to prosperity, Jesus is saying here that they need the gospel, the poverty need in them need to hear the Gospel.",

      "And this is the mystery of what Jesus plan to do, as we preach the Gosple of Christ to the poor, and the poor accept, then the poor himself will now preach the gospel to the poverty in him.",

      "And you must understand the language that those creatures can hear and that is the language of light, it is when you are speaking from the depth of light that they hear you.",

      "If you are sick, my assignment is to preach the gospel of healing to the sick once you believe, then the sick himself now preach the Gospel to the sickness.",

      "That is, in this light you are to see light,",

      `Psalms 36:9 For with You is the fountain of life;
In Your light we see light.`,

      "I am given you a light now from the fountain of life in me, my desire is that in this light you get personal light , your confession base on that personal light, produce anything you desire in life.",

      "So in that personal light you catch, lies the raw material to produce all you need, all you do is to speak it and you will surely have what you say.",

      "A sister was trusting God for the fruit of the womb in my church, I never pray for her, she was just at home and a scripture enter into her as light from the Holy Ghost, that if God can give us his son, will he not freely give us all things.",

      "Romans 8:32 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?",

      "As she got the light from that scripture, she said to her self, she need not to worry again that if God can give her his son Jesus freely, he will make her pregnant, and the second month she took in and become pregnant.",

      "What others are seeking men of God for, a light of the Holy  Ghost through the scripture deliver it to her.",

      "God created everything both the visible and the invisible from what is unseen.",

      "Hebrews 11:3 By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.",

      "And this is what make God to be God, the word God means a creator, that is, someone that can create something out of nothing, someone that can create something visible out of something invisible.",

      `2 Corinthians 4:6
For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness.....`,

      "And when God will be creating us, his intention is also to create us as god, If the son of  Goat is goat, the son of Dog is Dog, so also the son of God is god.",

      `Psalm 82:6-7 KJV
I have said, Ye are gods; And all of you are children of the most High.`,

      "Meaning, another name for sons of God is god.",

      "And if God means a creator, it mean a god is also a small creator, and what make you a God or god is the ability to create something.",

      "This means God also designed us to be a creator, Meaning, if you are not creating anything then you are not a god.",

      "A god is not a idol, a god is a creator.",

      "Everything God create and  made available for us is not the only things we need, that is the reason why God give us wisdom, he want us to use the wisdom in us to bring out what we need from what he has made available for us.",

      "For instance, God didn't create car for us, but he created raw materials needed to form a car for us and give us wisdom to discover how to get what we need from the raw materials he has give to us.",

      "A god is someone with the ability to create what he need for himself out of the raw material created by God.",

      "God never create petrol, kerosene, gas for us, he only creates crude oil for us and give us wisdom to create the petroleum, kerosene and gas from the raw materials.",

      "Get this to be a creator what you need is not power' what you need is wisdom, it is by wisdom God formed this Earth.",

      "Proverbs 3:19 The Lord by wisdom founded the earth;By understanding He established the heavens;",

      "Get this what make you a god is not power, it is wisdom, you are god when you have the ability to create something out of what God create for us.",

      "So men who can create something out of natural raw materials created by God are natural god, why men who can create something out of the spiritual raw material which is the scripture are spiritual god.",

      "Can I also shock you that God didn't create glory for us, he didn't create blessing of the lord that make man rich for us, he didn't create favour for us.",

      "But he give us the spiritual raw material needed to create those things for ourselves, and he give us the Spirit of wisdom which is the Holy Ghost to help us learn how to create what we need from what God made available for us' , but all we are doing with that holy ghost is to be using it to speak in tongues for 30 hours.",

      "We are still busy thinking of manifestation when God is talking manufacturing",

      "Just as men who are natural god laid hands on crude oil and create petroleum and gas out of it, so also God want we who are spiritual god to laid hold on the scripture (word of God) and create glory, blessing of the lord, goodness, mercy, favour out of it.",

      "So when the church suppose to be creating glory they gather on the mountain and are praying for glory, we are like someone who is crying for orange juice when God has given him orange tree.",

      "All you need is not orange juice, all you need is wisdom on how to create orange fruit from orange trees.",

      "All you need is wisdom on how to create glory out of the spiritual raw material known as the word of God, you can see why scripture say with all thy getting get wisdom.",

      "Pastor Banjo How could this be? How can I create healing out of the spiritual raw material which is the word of God?",

      "It is simple the scripture say the word of God that God use to create everything is no longer with God, that the word is now in our mouth.",

      "Romans 10:8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, IN YOUR MOUTH and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith which we preach):",

      "Then you may ask, why did God put in your mouth and in your heart?",

      "He put it in your heart so that you can think it and form what you need with the power of your imagination, and after you have formed it, you speak life to it and then you see the manifestation of it.",

      "Just as God form man from the soil and put life into him by breathe, same to us.",

      "For us the power of life is not in our breathe, the power of life is in our tongues,",

      "Proverbs 18:21 says “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.",

      "So everything we have created in our heart with our mind (imagination) then we speak life to them., Just as God breath life to adam and he woke up.",

      "Meaning everything you create with your imagination can remain in that realm just as Adam remain on the ground until God breathes into him.. the Breath(life and spirit) that everything you created in your imagination world needs to come into manifestation is in your tongues.",

      "So the word of God in your heart is to give you the picture of the future you are expecting, it give you the picture of the sound health you are expecting, it give you the picture of the prosperity you are expecting, so you create your future yourself with your mind with the spiritual raw material that come as light into your heart and after your heart has formed it, then let your mouth speak it, the role of your mouth is to give life to what you have created in your heart.",

      "Can you now understand why the scripture say as a man think so he is.",

      "In this kingdom, you become what you think and have what you say.",

      "This is what religion didn't understand, that they want to be putting the word in your life.",

      "God want the word to be in your heart so that you can think and imagine and be in your mouth so that you can speak it.",

      "But religion want the word to be in your life so that you can act it, so for 100 years all we are preaching is around moral holiness and righteousness.",

      "And many of us didn't know that we dont need those teaching to be truly holy and righteous' once you receive eternal life that life is a nature of holiness and righteousness by himself, you cannot have the life and continue in sin, it is a nature of God at work in us making us to will and to do his will.",

      "There are mystery of the kingdom we suppose to be doing business with which we are not touching, we are still busy talking about sin, all those are for baby Christians.",

      "But for the matured we know sin is no longer an issue, sin has lost the power , if you can solve the problem of law you solve the problems of sin, because law is the power of sin.",

      "1 Corinthians 15:56 The sting of death is sin, and the POWER of sin is the law.",

      "Back to the point, when God put his word in our heart and our mouth, he want us to use it the way he use it.",

      "Before God create everything into physical with his word, he first create everything in his heart, and that is what we called predestination, God foreknew them first and he speak them into existence.",

      "Same to you, he give you heart to think and imagine and the word should form your thinking and whatever you create with your heart base on what the promises of the word of God said about you then you speak it with your mouth.  That is the simple way to be a creator.",

      "A light of scripture came to you that you shall learn to nations.",

      "Deuteronomy 28:12 The Lord will open to you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand. You shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow.",

      "And you begin to imagine Federal republic of Ghana coming to your office to borrow money from you.. doing that is an act of creating in the spiritual realm, what next is for you to begin to speak into existence before men.",

      "Mind you at the time you are saying it, men will think you are mad, Because the same you that I'd talking just borrow 500 data from MTN, but just with time they will begin to see what you are saying taking shape in the spirit and coming to manifestation.",

      "May God open the eyes of your understanding to know why God put his word in your mouth.",

      "Your mouth is not primarily given to you to communicate, our falling nature was what bring us to that realm, from the foundation of the world our mouth is like factory tools, it is given to us to create.",

      "It is the instrument use to create what you need from the raw materials given to you which is the scripture.",

      "I said in the last page, in this kingdom we don't have what we do, we have what we say.",

      "Mark 11:23 For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, HE WILL HAVE WHATEVER HE SAYS.",

      "It is when Adam fell that God curse him to till the ground that men begin to have what he do, having what we do is a proof of a curse still finding expression in our life.",

      "Someone said but the scripture say we shall reap what we sow... yes sir' it all depends on what you define to be seed depending on where you are standing in the spirit realm.",

      "If you are standing in the realm of God with christ in the heavenly places your word become your seed.",

      "Luke 8:11b: The seed is the word of God.",

      "Because if the word of your father is a seed, then your word is also a seed meaning to sow is to speak, because the soil is in the spirit realm, and to reap what you sow mean to have what you say.",

      "We are designed by eternity to have what we say, we are to now do something with what we have, not do something to have.",

      "Before the fall of man, our thoughts and action is a communicating tools why our mouth is a creating tools.",

      "That is why men who can capture a measure of this reality come out with a theory and said action speak louder than voice.",

      "Before the fall of man, God didn't primarily create our mouth to be talking, Adam can pick what eve is saying by thought, then I can see what you are imagining.",

      "In the spirit you don't communicate with your mouth you communicate with your heart.",

      "Because then our thoughts is louder than the voice of our mouth.",

      "But the fall of man cause a lot of disorder we lost our creating abilities , we now begin to create by actions( sweat) and communicate by speaking ,but in Christ all has been restored.",

      "The power to create has been given to us back, all you need now is to begin to learn how to create what you need from the raw materials given to you by God.",

      "And the plan of God is that just as he have the ability to create the visible from the invisible, so also he designed us to create everything we need from the visible.",

      "I didn't say God designed us to create what we need from the unseen, that dimension is only in the capacity of God, the grace God give to us is the ability to to create everything we need from everything he made available for us physically.",

      "You can see scripture with your eyes, the word was once invisible, but God made it visible as bible ,because the strength of man is to create what we need from what is visible.",

      "Just be following, you'll get more truth on that tomorrow.",
