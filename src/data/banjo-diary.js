    title: "Making Peace With The Enemy.",
    content: [
      `I don't live a life of warfare because of the wisdom from the scripture that holy spirit taught me which I will be sharing in this diary.`,
      `It is wisdom of how to make peace with the enemy, this was the wisdom present in Solomon but was missing in David that made the life of David full of battle and made the life of Solomon to be free from battle.`,
      `1 Chronicles 22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. Look at what Solomon himself said about his father david;`,
      `1 Kings 5:3 You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the Lord his God because of the wars which were fought against him on every side, until the Lord put his foes under the soles of his feet.`,
      `1 Kings 5:4 But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence.
        The question is what is the wisdom behind a battle free life? It is the wisdom of learning how to make peace with your enemy.
        And we see Jesus giving this as a code in Luke 14:31 but many could not decode it. `,
      `Luke 14:31-32
        [31]“Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10,000 could defeat the 20,000 soldiers marching against him?
        [32]And if he can’t, he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away.`,
      `I don't know the interpretation you may give to this scripture, but there a deep revelational wisdom that Holy ghost taught me from it that is working for me.
        Many thought everything you do with the enemy is to make war with him, but many didn't know that there is wisdom in the Spirit to make peace with the enemy.`,
      `Get this mystery, every enemy you see in life that is still powerful attacking believers, the plan of God is for us to make peace with them and not make war with them.
        While the enemy that needed warfare which doesn't understand the language of peace are the enemy that Christ has come to deal with for us, those enemies you can't fight them, God himself have come down as Christ and fought them for us.`,
      `And he told us clearly in his word that over those enemy we are to hold our peace because he will fight for us.
        Exodus 14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
        He didn't say you should fight for yourself, he didn't say I will empower you to fight for yourself,  but he said I, God will fight for you, all you need to do is to fold your arms and enter your peace and rest.`,
      `He gave this as prophecy in Exodus and we see it coming to pass by Christ when God came as flesh to fight that enemy for us.
        Such enemies are called principalities, the scripture says Christ has put them in public shame for us.
        Colossians 2:15
        And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
        Every other enemy remaining, we are to make peace with them, that is why our weapons of warfare is not power, but wisdom, even the sword of the spirit is not fire, it is the word of God 
        God never told us to wrestle with demon or go in warfare with demon, he only told us to cast him out in the life of those not born again who are demon possessed, but if demon himself is coming for you, facing and fighting them will cause you many unrest in life, there are hidden wisdom available for us to make peace with demon .( just open your mind and be following).
        Have you come across scripture that define wisdom as the greatest weapon of warfare?
        Ecclesiastes 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war;`,
      `Ecclesiastes 9:18(NLT)
        [18]Better to have wisdom than weapons of war, 
        What is God saying to us in this scripture that we don't pay due attention to?
        To you power should be the greatest weapon of warfare,  so you are busy crying for power, but God is saying better to have wisdom than all weapon of warfare. 
        When you hold wisdom in your hand as weapon of warfare, it is not to attack the enemy but to make peace with the enemy so as to let you go. Have you observed that in most cases if God gives you power, it is to solve people's problems minus your own problems?`,
      `Go back to the book of God's generals and see how mighty men fell at the feet of the enemy with their power, due to some decision not guided with wisdom that they took, 
        have you observed that highest percentage of the books of God's generals never ended well, many of us only read their miraculous story but we never paid attention to their ending. 
        For David, God taught his hands to war and that is the picture of Christ but for Solomon, God taught him to make peace with the enemy and that is the picture of the church.
        That is why the scripture keep on calling us more than a conqueror but yet we cannot understand the meaning.`,
      `Romans 8:37
        Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
        We still carry the mentality of warfare, which is fighting to conquer, but the scripture keep on calling us more than conquerors.
        A conqueror is the person that fight his enemy and win by power.
        While more than conqueror is the person that have the skills and wisdom to settle with his enemy and they are living in peace, God now begin to prepare a table before him in the presence of his enemy. `,
      `God's plan is for the wheat and the tares to grow together,  but we want to be separating them and fighting the tares.( Mathew 13:25:30)
        I don't know the enemy you have, be it the enemy of your health which is sickness, enemy of your finance which is poverty, enemy of your progress which is stagnation, enemy of your rest which is frustration, all these enemies are spirit, there are wisdom in the spirit that can make you to make peace with them, and they will effortlessly leave you alone permanently. `,
      `Infact, God is taking something relating to this for us in the scripture but we aren't getting the code, he said I will make your enemy to be at peace with you.
        Proverbs 16:7 When a man’s ways please the Lord,
        He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
        He didn't say I will kill your enemy for you, he didn't say I will fight your enemy for you, but he said I will make them to be at peace with you.`,
      `Take note of these two scriptures;`,
      `1. Proverbs 16:7 where God said I will make your enemy to be at peace with you. 
        2. Exodus 14:14 where God is saying I will fight for you.
        There are two enemy we must pay attention to that we have. 
        The first one is the enemy that God came to fight for us.
        The second enemy God didn't come to fight them for us, he came to make them to be at peace with us.
        There are enemy that God fight for us, and we see Jesus coming to deal with that, any enemy you are fighting now, it is a lack of your revelational knowledge of your position in Christ.
        While the second enemy, God didn't deal with them at the cross, they are the enemy the scripture talk about when he told Jesus "sit at my right hand until I make all your enemy to be under your foot"`,
      `Matthew 22:44 ‘The Lord said to my Lord,
        “Sit at My right hand,
        Till I make Your enemies Your footstool”’?
        Meaning not all the enemy have been conquered yet.
        Meaning there are some enemy that aren't yet under the feet of Jesus, this enemy, we don't fight them by fire, they don't die by fire, trying to attack them put you more in trouble, that is why many warfare churches never enter their rest, it is battle always and yet those enemies never die, the more they pray and do warfare prayer, the more the enemy wage war against them.`,
      `Have you observed that many of our mothers have been fighting this battle in praying vigil for over 20 years and yet they handed over the same pattern to us and we never questioned it that something is wrong with this warfare prayer.
        What is this battle we are fighting for over 20 years with prayer and yet never solve, is that battle powerful more than the name of Jesus, is God no longer on the throne?
        A wisdom is only missing in us, people are perishing not because they don't pray but because they lack revelational knowledge. `,
      `They don't know that there are two enemy, the first one which Christ has dealt with for us and he has put them in open shame, while the second are the enemy not yet under the foot of jesus and this enemy you dont fight them, you make peace with them.
        Look at the parable Jesus gave on how to handle this kind of enemy.
        Luke 14:31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?`,
      `Luke 14:32 Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.
        Take note of the first bible verse, 
        This is a battle between two kings.
        You are a king, the enemies also are kings.
        And the scripture say when the first king noticed that the weapon of his enemy is more than his own, he quickly sent delegates to his enemy and make peace with him.
        There are enemy that God want you to handle like that.`,
      `I know you are full of fire, but I tell you, calm down, if all your life is full of battle, you can never make progress in life, infact you can't be a tool in building God's church,  such is the case of David.
        If all your life is about battles then where is the place of rest that God promised us ? 
        You can't be wiser than the scripture that say wisdom is better than all weapons of war.
        This scripture is a promise you can claim it, and free yourself from all this warfare mentality,  they are stronghold you need to be free from. `,
      `Can you claim this scripture for yourself and put your name in it ..and see how life in Christ can be full of peace and rest. 
        1 Chronicles 22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be BANJO AYEKA, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.`,
      `The question is how can I make peace with my enemy?
        Let us journey again by tomorrow, it is a 365 days journey in the spirit, you will see how your spiritual life will shift and grow within one year.`,

    title: "Negotiating With The Enemy.",
    content: [
      `Have you sat down to ask yourself how Jesus overcame the enemy for us? By warfare and fighting the devil ? No sir, it was by making peace with the enemy on our behalf.`,
      `That is, they entered into negotiation at the conference house of immortality and ask the devil to name his price for him to release us.`,
      `The scripture says we were bought by the blood of Jesus. `,
      `1 Corinthians 6:20 For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.`,
      `Bought from who and bought by who? Bought from the devil and by Christ.

      If you want to buy something from someone, you don't first determine how much you want to pay, the seller determines how much he want to sell, then because of how much you love what you want to buy or redeem, you then enter into peaceful negotiation with the seller.`,
      `This is what the scripture describes as redemption.

      Redemption means (apolutrósis) and it's a situation whereby Christ purchases us, he ransomed us, with the price of his own life, securing our deliverance from the bondage.`,
      `That word “redeem” is a language of the marketplace in both the Greek and the Roman cultures in Paul’s day.

      The question is who did Jesus bought us from ? Jesus didn't buy us from God, he bought us from the devil, meaning, it wasn't God that demanded the life of Jesus, it was the devil that demanded for the life of Jesus as price before he could release us.`,
      `And  Christ didn't ask devil to die by fire but he paid the price for our release, he never hijacked us from the enemy by his powers through warfare but he released us with his life  through negotiation.

      What is the mystery of negotiating with the enemy that many of us don't understand?
      
      You may ask why did devil demand for Jesus in our place and in exchange of us? it was because devil knows that if he can have Jesus he already have everything.`,
      `Do you remember when he was asking Jesus to bow down for him in exchange of the whole world, they are talking business here, you are busy talking warfare, buying and selling is warfare in the spirit, market place is a battle field, devil mean business here when he was asking Jesus to bow so he'll give Jesus the whole world and it's Glory.`,
      `Luke 4:5 Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.`,
      `Luke 4:6 And the devil said to Him, “All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.`,
      `Luke 4:7 Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours.”`,
      `Because he want Jesus and he prefer to have Jesus under him than having the whole world under him, so he threw his negotiation to Jesus.

      But what Jesus need was not the world and it's glory, there is something in the hand of the devil that Jesus also need, and that is our souls, our souls are in the hand of the devil and Jesus also desire to have it, and Jesus ask him to name his price.`,
      `And he demanded for the life of Jesus in exchange for our life, in his own wisdom he felt once he can have Jesus he have everything, because he knew by Jesus everything both in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible was created, and Jesus surrendered his life to him in exchange of our life.

      You can see peaceful negotiation in the Spirit realm. This is the All-Powerful God, what is God trying to do here that we didn't understand ? this is what Paul referred to as the foolishness of God.`,
      `1 Corinthians 1:25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.`,
      `Because how can you refuse to hijack your people whom you love from the hand of the enemy when you have the power but rather go for negotiation with the enemy. That sound foolish in the realm of man that felt life is by force, but that is wisdom in the realm of God where they know that life is by talk (word).
      Is devil so important like that for God to go on negotiating with him before he released us? Devil is not as important as that.`,
      `But there is a wisdom of warfare that many never understood, all we know is to fight the enemy by facing the enemy, we fight spirit as if we are fighting flesh and blood.

      We get angry at spirit the way we get angry at humans beings, we call it holy anger, and devil keep on laughing at us because he knows that anger rest in the bosom of fools.`,
      `Ecclesiastes 7:9 Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry, For anger rests in the bosom of fools.`,
      `Whenever God want to get angry at his enemy he laughs, that is why the scripture says he that sitted in heavens shall laugh.`,
      `Psalms 2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves,
      And the rulers take counsel together,
      Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying,
      
      Psalms 2:3 “Let us break Their bonds in pieces
      And cast away Their cords from us.”
      
      Psalms 2:4 He who sits in the heavens shall laugh;The Lord shall hold them in derision.`,

      `Take note of verse 4 to see the reaction of God to the enemy.
      "He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision."
      
      The way God expresses anger to spirit which are invisible creature is different from the way God expresses anger to men which are visible creatures.
      
      If you can't fight spirit the way God is fighting them, then you don't understand spiritual warfare yet.`,
      `The highest level of warfare in the spirit is negotiation. A situation whereby you ask the enemy to name the price and give him what he wants.

      Any country who adopt this principle end up becomimg a peaceful nation, it is a law of the spirit.
      
      There was a time the militants were disturbing the south south region of the nation Nigeria, everyone was advising the then president to raise warfare with them, because he is the commander in the chief of Armed forces, but the president was so wise enough to understand the code of the spirit, he called them into negotiation and asked them to name their price and they entered into agreement and that became the end of war. He make peace with the enemy.`,
      `This was also what Christ did with the enemy. 

      The question is why didn't Jesus hijack us from the devil, why does he have to stoop so low to the level of buying when all power and authority to hijack us is in his hands? 
      
      Because our weapon of warfare in the body of Christ today is far from the way Jesus did his own warfare and we claim he is the one we are looking unto as the author and finisher of our faith.`,

      `But we see Jesus negotiating with the devil here asking him to name his price, and giving the devil the cost of the price of our soul.

      I tell you a mystery today that you can negotiate with sickness,  poverty,  backwardness, and they will eternally leave you alone, they will eternally make peace with you, just be following this devotionals.`,
      `The word redeem means to buy back, Jesus didn't enter into the gate of hell and hades to hijack us by warfare, he went on negotiation at the round table to seek for their price, negotiate it with them and trasfer the price to the bank account of the devil and when the devil saw the alert, he released us all. 

      This sound to be downgrading the integrity of the Almighty, negotiating with ordinary so called Satan, but it is a mystery of warfare many doesn't understand, it is not reconciling with the enemy, it is making peace with the enemy for a purpose which you will see as you read this teaching.`,
      `Many of us are fighting like angels who go on warfare with the devil rather than we fighting like Jesus, who goes on negotiations with the devil. 

      This now makes us begin to quote the book of revelation out of context where the scripture says that there was war in heaven, we felt there must also be war on Earth.`,
      `Revelation 12:7 Satan Thrown Out of Heaven
      And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,
      
      Revelation 12:8 but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer.
      Revelation 12:9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.`,
      `There is no wisdom in the method of warfare between the Angel and devil in the heavenly places stated in this scripture, but we don't pay spiritual attention to it.

      The scripture says when an angel prevailed over the devil with warfare, he sent satan to Earth. `,
      `Revelation 12:9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.`,
      `Was it Earth he suppose to cast Satan to or hell? 

      It is like one enemy came to fight you and claim you defeated him but only for you to send him out of your room but send him to the room of the children of your boss, truly you are free but the children of your boss are now in danger. 
      
      You only fought for your life, but never considered the children of your master, such was what Micheal did.`,
      `No one go into warfare with the enemy and not loose something ,truly you may win someone, but you will lose something, there is always side effect of every warfare and many of us didn't know this, and we saw the side effect of the warfare Angel Michael did with the devil here now.

      Angels are servant of God, why we are predestined sons of God, and Micheal in his warfare now sent Satan out of the realm of the servants of God (Angels) and cast him to the realm of we whom God is mindful of.`,
      `Can I call this jealousy, when you know that God is mindful of men.`,
      `Psalms 8:4 What is man that You are mindful of him,And the son of man that You visit him?

      Psalms 8:5 For You have made him a little lower than the angels,
      And You have crowned him with glory and honor.
      
      Psalms 8:6 You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands;
      You have put all things under his feet,`,
      `Why will Angel Micheal cast the devil to Earth rather than casting him to hell, when he knows that Earth is the habitant of the creature that God love most, which is man.

      Our suffering on Earth today now was the negative effect of the victory of Angel Micheal with the devil in the heavenly places. There is no wisdom in such warfare but we didn't know, they now have peace in Heaven because devil is no longer there but woe unto the Earth for devil has been sent to you. `,
      `Revelation 12:12 Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.”`,
      `Why will angel Micheal be so selfish like that, Heaven is not our place, what the scripture says is that the Earth he has given to the children of man, Earth is our habitat.`,
      `Psalms 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s;
      But the Earth He has given to the children of men.`,
      `Infact, after rapture we are not going to Heaven, Heaven is not our home, we are going to a new Earth. `,
      `Revelation 21:1 All Things Made New
      Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea.`,
      `So Earth is what is designed for the children of God and that same Earth is designed to be the habitant of God's children,  the servant of God called Micheal now cast Satan to that same environment of the children of God just because he wanted the environment of the servant of God which are the angels to be peaceful. 

      The sons of God are now in woes, while the servants of God who are the angels are now enjoying.`,
      `NKJV, Revelation 12:12
      Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.”`,
      `That is why Solomon by the help of the Spirit said he has seen something under heaven that the princes who are the sons of God are struggling on earth while the servants who are the angels are riding on chariot of horses.`,
      `Ecclesiastes 10:7 I have seen servants on horses, While princes walk on the ground like servants.`,
      `Each time men in the scripture capture the picture of angels in their vision, you see them on chariots or horses, that is their reality, and they are servants, but many princes of the king which are the children of God are struggling on Earth. 

      Many of us blame Adam that through him, sin entered into the Earth, but we didn't know that the problem was through the warfare method of Angel Micheal who sent Satan to the Earth rather than sending him to hell. `,
      `Truly by Adam sin came into the Earth, but I tell you that by Angel Micheal Satan came into the Earth. 

      Hell was the place God prepared for Satan not Earth, that is why the scripture now said that another angel now come in revelation 20 and cast Satan from Earth to the bottomless pit.`,
      `Revelation 20:1 
      Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
      
      Revelation 20:2 He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;
      
      Revelation 20:3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while.`,
      `If Micheal fought with wisdom, this is what he could have done, that is he could have sent him to hell and not to Earth.

      Someone is saying how will you be talking to a whole angel Micheal like this.`,
      `Please don't think I am trying to be rude to angel Micheal, I am only tapping into the wisdom of the world to come by which we'll posses to judge Angels, because just as we have the power of the world to come so also we have the wisdom of the world to come, and men who can tap into the wisdom of the world to come will understand what I am saying. 

      There are many of the angelic activities that finds expression both in Heaven and on Earth which we have given accolades to which we're going to judge on the last day. The scripture told us clearly that we shall judge angels.`,
      `1 Corinthians 6:3 Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?`,
      `I love the way amplified version puts it.`,
      `1cor 6:3
      3 Do you not know also that we [Christians] are to judge the [very] angels and pronounce opinion between right and wrong [for them]? How much more then [as to] matters pertaining to this world and of this life only!`,
      `The scripture is not talking about falling angels here, it is talking about Holy angels.

      We are not judging falling Angels because they have been judged already, but we are going to judge Holy angels because they are not also perfect in their act and deed, and one of it is what i am revealing now by the wisdom of the world to come.
      
      The scripture say angels are not Holy also in the sight of God `,
      `Job 15
      15 Behold, [God] puts no trust in His holy ones [the angels]; indeed, the heavens are not clean in His sight--( Amplified version)`,
      `Meaning, there are certain act of imperfections Angels are  expressing which many didn't know, the fearful honour we have for them make us to think they are perfect, they are holy but they are not perfect.

      And one of their imperfection  is what I am expressing to you now which Angel Michael did.
      
      We are going to judge the rights and wrongs of Angels.`,
      `We  look at angels with fear  because we don't know our identity and they are also looking at us with fear because they know our identity, they know they are servants of God and they know we are sons of God, they know we're the one that will judge them.

      We see them as servants of God and they see us as the children of their master and their judge.`,
      `They are designed to be mighty in strength than us because of their assignment for us why we are designed to be wiser than them because of our position in Christ.

      That is why the scripture say the manifold wisdom of God is designed to be made known by the church to the angels.`,
      `Ephesians 3:
      10 [The purpose is] that through the church the [c]complicated, many-sided wisdom of God in all its infinite variety and innumerable aspects might now be made known to the angelic rulers and authorities (principalities and powers) in the heavenly sphere.`,
      `I tell you today that men are not the only one reading this teaching, Angels are also reading to learn from it.

      So if I am trying to bring corrections to what Angels did, don't think I am speaking heresy, i know the realm at which i am talking from.
      
      Just saying this for you to know that the method of warfare of Angel Micheal is not given to us by God to copy, we are not to learn from that, it is not a perfect method of warfare, 
      the method through which Christ put captivity into captive and give gift to men is the method we are to follow.`,
      `And that is the principle of negotiations, the principles of making peace with the enemy. 

      Now the question is how can I negotiate with the devil, how can I make peace with the enemy? How can my enemy also be at peace with me? How can I also adopt this wisdom over sickness, poverty, or any of your enemy?
      
      Just be following, at night devotion, you will see the wisdom from the scripture and you will see how a man can be eternally free from battle of life `,

      "We have been using some days now to open a dimension of spiritual reality to us which is the mystery of negotiating with the enemy for peace to reign,  rather than calling for battle for war to reign, because a Christian that his life is full of battle can never make progress in life",

      "The question is , is battle free Christian life posible at all? Yes, because it is part of Gods promise for us",

      "1 Chronicles 22:9",
      "But you will have a son who will be a man of peace. I WILL GIVE HIM PEACE WITH HIS ENEMIES in all the surrounding lands. His name will be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel during his reign",

      "Take note of that scripture,  I will give him peace with all his enemies,  not I will kill all his enemy, but both him and his enemy will be living together in peace, God will be preparing a table before him in the presence of his enemy",

      "Now the question is how can I make peace with the enemy? How can I negotiate with the devil to leave my life alone? Because the wisdom of making peace with the enemy was what make all the enemies of Jerusalem to have peace with Jerusalem in the days of Solomon, that was why he could successfully build the temple of the lord",

      "And we see Jesus also referring to this pertains in the book of luke 14",

      "Luke 14:31-32",
      `Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10,000 could defeat the 20,000 soldiers marching against him?",
"[32] And if he can’t, he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away`,

      "Now the question is how can I discuss the terms and condition of peace while my enemies are still far away",

      "It is very simple, it is by giving to the devil what you have that it is not Christ that gave to you, because every of your things with the devil has been bought back by the blood of the Lamb, so every of his things with you must also must be surrendered back to him",

      "If you enter into the negotiations table with the devil and ask him what does he want in other to leave you alone, the true fact is that all he wants is your life, and what Christ expects from you is to surrender your life back to him because he has  given you a new life, which is eternal life, so let the old life pass away",

      "Can you now understand why the scripture says we overcome him because we are not afraid to lose our life?",

      "Revelation 12:11",
      "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death",

      "The problem of many of us is that we receive a new life by faith and still hold unto our old life in fear, we receive the new life which is eternal life know as the life of christ, but we are afraid to loose our life know as the old life which is the life of the devil in us",

      "God's will is for you to surrender your life to the devil just as Jesus did",

      "We don't surrender our life to Jesus, Jesus doesn't need our life, he came to give us a new life, and all you need to receive that new life is to BELIEVE.( john 3:16)",

      "And you don't surrender your life so that you can receive a new life, you have already received a new life by faith that is why you need to surrender your old life back to the owner in peace, ( Dont find devils trouble)",

      "It is the enemy that is demanding for your life, because the life belong to them and all you do is to give it to him, that is the negotiating price if you can understand what the Spirit is saying",

      "Get this, the new life in you can never be attacked with sickness or poverty, if that new life becomes sick then God is sick, if that new life is poor then God is poor, if God can never be sick and poor then the new life can never be sick and poor",

      "For the devil to still be attacking your financial life  means you still have financial life",

      "For me I don't have any financial life, the life in me now is the life of Christ, so the financial life in me now is the financial life of Christ, I have been crucified with christ, so you can't attacked a crucified life, he is attacked already,  crucification is the highest form of attack",

      "Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me",

      "The scripture says Christ is now my new life",

      "Colossians 3:3 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God",

      "Devil can't kill me, because he has killed me already, it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me",

      "And Christ gave me a new life and the scripture says that new life is hidden in Christ",

      "Colossians 3:3 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God",

      "The devil that will attack this new life doesn't exist, the scripture says it is hidden in Christ, the devil could fight my old life because the life was hidden in me, but the devil can't touch my new life because it is hidden in Christ",

      "Devil is touching your financial life because it is hidden in you, devil can't touch my financial life because it is hidden in christ",

      "And that your financial life, christ doesn't want you to surrender it to him, there is nothing he want to do with it, all you do is to surrender it to the owner and come to Jesus empty and let him give you a new financial life, let him teach you how to save the treasure he blessed you with, called heavenly bank Account where nothing can touch it",

      "Matthew 6:20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal",

      "My own financial life, I have surrendered it to the devil, so as to make peace with him, I can't be fighting financial warfare, so I will rather surrender my financial life to him so as to have the financial life of the Lord. Anything that belongs to the new life is eternally free from any attack while everything that belongs to the old life in you is eternally exposed to the attacks of the enemy",

      "Anything that you have and it is not christ that gives it to you is exposed to attack why everything Christ gives you is free from attack, everything he gives is eternally secured, it is under eternal security",

      "It is when you hijack what God gives to you and makes yourself the owner that you open yourself to attack, but if you make yourself a steward you garrison yourself from attack",

      "If it is YOUR ministry, such a ministry can never be free from attack, but if it is GOD'S ministry in your hand, such a ministry is eternally secured",

      "So if old things have not passed away in your life and if everything has not become new, that aspect that has not passed away and become new is not free from attack, as you are coming out of one warfare over it you will be entering into another warfare over it, until you learn to make peace with the devil by surrendering back to him what belongs to him, your old life doesn't belong to God, it belongs to the devil",

      "Inability to give the devil what he demands is the reason behind many of our warfare",

      "we receive a new life from christ but we have not surrendered our life, and that is why the devil is attacking it",

      "If your enemy is not at peace with you, may you be humble enough to know that it is because your way didn't please God",

      "Because what the word of God said is that if your way pleases the Lord, he will make your enemy to be at peace with you",

      `Proverbs 16:7 When a man’s ways please the Lord,
He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him`,

      "How does Jesus overcome the devil? It is by surrendering his life to the devil to kill it, it is the mystery of negotiations, at the time the devil will come to Jesus, he couldn't find anything in him again because he had surrendered everything to him",

      "John 14:30 I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me",

      "Such is also the pattern you use to overcome the devil, we don't overcome in this kingdom by warfare, we overcome by surrender! Every thing of him that is with us is all he is demanding for, I am not talking about sin, but I am talking about that your good will and good plan you have for yourself that is not God's will and God's plan",

      "If not because we don't look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, is it not the same pattern he overcame the devil that should be the same pattern we are to overcome him? Jesus overcame by surrender",

      "The devil demanded for his life and he gave it to him, and once you believe in Jesus and receive a new life also, the first thing you do is to surrender your old life back to the devil who is the owner, he owns the life so kindly give him back his life. I don't know what you want to be doing with old life and new life together",

      "And I'd you don't surrender them back to him, he will surely come for them, and the act of him coming for his life which he gave to us back  we begin to drag it with him is what we define to be warfare, we now spiritualize it and call it warfare prayer",

      "The question is how do you surrender to the devil?",

      "It is not by looking for the devil about, all you do is just to remove your hand from your life and let him have it, the devil automatically takes your life once you remove your hand from it",

      "Once you remove your hand from your life, devil automatically have it, warfare is when you are dragging your life with him, you are dragging your financial life with him, dragging your marital life with him, dragging your career life with him but can you surrender everything to him, and come to Jesus empty handed so as to receive everything new from him",

      "We win by hands up (Surrender)",

      "How does Jesus surrender his life ? It is by just removing his hands from his life, he was not trying to save his life, when you try to keep it from the enemy you loose it to the enemy, but when you loose it, you have a new one back",

      "Once you surrender your life, and he comes for it, all you do is to turn to Jesus to receive a new life and follow the way of that new life",

      "Because once you receive new life, then you must begin to learn a new way of everything",

      "For instance, your old life have a way of prospering in life which is by seeking what he need and running after what he need",

      "But in this new life now, you must begin to learn the new way, which is by seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness every other things shall be added",

      "The old life is a way of sense and sight, but the new life is a way of Faith and scripture, in the new life you see through the lens of the scripture",

      "With the old life, you see through the lens of the WORLD and follow what the WORLD says but with the new life, you see with the lens of the WORD and follow what the WORD say",

      `You will understand this the day you know that spiritual realm is govern by covenant, that is why we have old covenant and new covenant 
which is agreement, and the new covenant is for the new life`,

      `That realm is not a natural realm where they breach covenant, if you understand what devil demand to make peace with you and you give it to him, he can never and never touch your life again, he understand covenant`,

      "And the covenant is that everything that is yours has been bought from him by the blood of the lamb and everything that is his own in you which is your life, your plan, your ambition, your will, your want , your desire, must be surrendered back to him",

      "And then pick up the new life , new plan, new will, New way that Christ has set before you, and you see God making your enemy to be at peace with you",

      "Many of us didn't know that what comprises the old life is not only evil life, the tree we ate is not the tree of evil, it is tree of good and evil, meaning the old life have two fruit, which is the fruit of good and evil",

      "And what many of us did was that we do away with the evil fruit of the old life and maintain the good fruit of the old life, and we called it morality, we call it good way and that is what every religion including Christian religion preaches,  and that is not true christianity",

      "But when you are ready to walk with Jesus, you will surrender that good fruit to follow God's fruit",

      "There is one thing to deny what is evil and follow what is good, that is morality, and the society love you for that, while there is another thing to deny what is good and follow what is God and that is spirituality and society reject you for that and called you fool",

      "So whenever you surrender the evil ways and follow good ways you see devil coming after that good ways, you will now begin to think why is evil happen to good people?",

      "That your way pleases society doesn't mean it pleases the lord",

      "There is nothing bad going out of the country to the USA, to some it may be God's will,  but to you, it may only be good will but not God's will",

      "And once it is good but not God's will, you see the devil coming after it, you now see everything working against you at embassy, You now begin to move from one prayer mountain seeking for breakthrough",

      `The question is , is it God's will "for you? If yes just enter your rest, because if anything is God's will, the devil that will stop it doesn't exist, if it is God's will, God automatically makes all your enemy to be at peace over it. If it is God's will, God will be for you, and if God is for you, who can be against you over that visa, job opportunities or contract`,

      "Jesus said I set before you an open door , no man or devil can shut it",

      "Revelation 3:8 “I know your works. See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it",

      "If the devil shut the door of USA against you, then it is not God that open the door for you, you only want to open it yourself, and once it is your self and your will, you will have devil to contend with",

      "If God is for you who will be against you?",

      "And God can't be for you, If you are talking a step not according to his will, that a plan is good, legit and moral  doesn't mean it is Gods will for you",

      "So when you see devil againsting you in anything just know God is not for you in that things, and God is not for you because it is not his will for you that time",

      "You must understand the difference between Gods will for you in life and Gods will for you per  time",

      "It is Gods will for you to have a car in life, but it may not be Gods will for you to have it now, and if you want to force yourself to have it now, you will have devil to contend with, you may buy it by your selfish force and have accident with it",

      "God doesn't take control of what you do according to your will,  he only take control of what you do according to his will",

      "So once you begin to notice any attack over any aspect of your life, just know that there is something that is of the devil with you, just go into negotiations with him and give him back what he needs",

      "To some it may just be your will, truly it may good will, but devil is demanding for it, so give it to him, and face the will of God for you, no devil can touch anything that is Gods will",

      "Give him back the visa, just surrender that your USA plan , and wait for God's time, if it is God's will for you to be in the USA, you will surely be their at God's time",

      "You can't use warfare prayer to go your ways,  it is only when you pray according to his will that is when he hears you",

      "That is why the best prayer is God let your will be done",

      "When Jesus was seeking his way, he prayed for hours and sweat came out of his body like blood and yet God never answered him, for you to know that it is not by gymnastic prayers,  but when Jesus just said let your will be done, he never spent a minute again, he stood up",

      "Meaning, Jesus was using hours to pray wrong prayer and God never heard him then he used a minute to pray right prayer and the  heaven opened",

      "But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered."`,

      "The first is that the Righteous shall live by FAITH.( Romans 1:17)",

      "And the Second is that the Righteous shall be delivered through KNOWLEDGE.( Proverbs 11:9)",

      "Ask me why do many righteous got frustrated and confused in life? I will tell you that the answer is because they are trying to live by sight, principles and fact, whereas, they have been ordained by God to live by Faith",

      "Ask me why are many righteous in captive and yet with all their prayers it look as if nothing is working for them, I will tell you that the answer is because the righteous are trying to obtain deliverance by fasting, prayer and power when they have been ordained to be delivered through knowledge.(Light)",

      "Look at the scripture again",

      "Proverbs 11:9",
      "But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered.",

      "Meaning, whenever deliverance is coming to them, the channel through which the deliverance will come is knowledge.",

      "There is one thing to know the source through which your solution will come, and there is another thing to know the channel through which it will come, once you are righteous the sources of your solution is God, and the channel is knowledge, that is why a righteous can remain in captivity with all his fasting and prayer because of lack of knowledge, and the scripture cannot broken.",

      "Rather than breaking the scripture and go free, the scripture will rather break you to make you free.",

      "The moment you are righteous, just know that your deliverance has been ordained to come through knowledge, infact knowledge become the channel through which all that is available for you will be available in you",

      "2 Peter 1:3 as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, THROUGH THE KNOWLEDGE of Him who called us by glory and virtue",

      "The scripture say the divine power of God has given us everything we need. Then the question is how do we get it into our life? It is through knowledge",

      "Faith is like the currency you used to buy what you need in the market of the spirit, why revelational knowledge is like the truck through which you pack those thing you got by faith into your house.",

      "Revelational knowledge is a channel through which spiritual blessing that is available for you is now available in you.",

      `From God, means the SOURCE 
      By faith in Christ means the TOOLS, Through knowledge means the CHANNEL`,

      ` If you get any deliverance in life and it doesn't come through knowledge, then you are not righteous.`,

      "For the righteous, it is what you know that is designed to set you free from anything, not what you do.",

      "What you do only PREVENT you from problem but never DELIVER you from problem, but what you know is what deliver you from problem, that is, your deliverance is designed to come by revelational knowledge, by light of the scripture.",

      "The scripture didn't say you shall DO the truth and the truth you do shall set you free, but you shall KNOW the truth. Truth is not something you do, it is someone you know, and the person you know is Christ, i didn't mean Jesus that died for you, I mean Christ, and who is Christ? He is light, each time you capture any light from the scripture, the light you caught is Christ, Christ is not a person with flesh and blood, he is light of the world.",

      "There is something called the power of darkness.",

      "Colossians 1:13 He has delivered us from the POWER OF DARKNESS and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.",

      "Meaning, if there is power of darkness, there will be power of light.",

      "Many of us only know the power of the Holy Ghost but we don't know the power of light.",

      "The power of light come through revelation of the word of God, that you can have any sickness in your body and a scripture appears to you that by his stripes you are healed, and based on that revelation, the sickness in your body disappears, what you just experienced is called the power of light.",

      "The power of the Holy Ghost comes through a man of God to you, while the power of light come through the word of God to you.",

      "And many of us only run after the men of God that come with the power of God to you, and never follow men of God that come with the word of God to you, it is a sign that you are a baby Christian.",

      "Because there are two things that the Holy Ghost  sent to us and deliver us from our destruction.",

      `1. He sent his men to heal us "and deliver us"`,

      "2 He also sent his word and delivered us.",

      `Psalms 107:20 He sent His word and healed them,
      And delivered them from their destructions.`,

      "That is, by the power of light from the word, you can be free from any problem.",

      "Just as you can be healed and delivered from your destruction by the power of the Holy Ghost through a man of God sent by God, so also you can be healed from your sickness and delivered from your destruction by the light of the Holy Ghost through the word",

      "From my observation I discovered that the church is more familiar with the power of the Holy Ghost, but we are not familiar with the light of the Holy Ghost.",

      "And many of us didn't know that the righteous have only been ordained to be delivered by the light (revelational knowledge) of the Holy Ghost.",

      "The same lord that is the word is also the Spirit, if he is coming as light he come as the word, why if he is coming as fire he come as Spirit.",

      "That is why we have two different men of God raised by God into the body or Christ.",

      "It is either God sends you with the POWER of the Holy Spirit, or God sends you with the LIGHT of the Holy Ghost.",

      "The two can accomplish same result but to different people.",

      "I tell you clearly today that if you get any deliverance by the power of God, that is a pure evidence that you are not righteous and may you be humble enough to accept this.",

      "I didn't mean moral righteousness, what I mean is that you have not obtained the gift of righteousness that comes by Faith, you are still under the law where you think justification is by moral righteousness.",

      "Romans 4:3 For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.",

      "Get this and get this, once you are under Faith and Grace, your deliverance doesn't come through power it come through knowledge (revelational light) it comes through the light of the Holy Ghost.",

      "But for those under the law, or those in the world the instrument through which God meet their deliverance is through power of God.",

      "Once you are born again and you have come to the revelational knowledge that righteousness only come by Faith, heaven will declares you righteous by Faith not by law, and I beseech you to begin to learn to do business with light, because there is something called the power of light, and that same power can produce result as the power of the Holy Spirit.",

      "If you are sick in your body and you are moving from healing crusade about, you will not get any healing, everyone will be healed expect you, because those that heaven has declared righteous are not designed to get their healing through that pattern, you get your healing by light from the word of God, because what God has sent to heal you is not men of God but word of God.",

      "For those still under the law (the self righteous people) and in the world (the unrighteous people) God in his mercy sent men to heal them and deliver them from their destruction,  but for the saint, who have been declared righteous and have been justified by Faith God sent his word to heal them.",

      "Can you see why even though the scripture say by his stripes you are healed and yet you still have sickness in your body, it is because instead of you to be seeking for light, you are seeking for prayer mountain.",

      "Do you ever see the Apostles doing any deliverance in the church or doing any healing in the gathering of the saint? They did all their miracles in the streets for those who are yet to come to faith, his shadows was healing people in the streets not in the church.",

      "Do you ever notice that Jesus never did any miracle or healing for his deciples, theological research make us to understand that james was sick in his body even as a deciples of Jesus, the sickness in his body was what brought his teaching in james 1 vs 2",

      My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials`,

      `But Jesus heal the sick and raised the death by the power of the holy ghost but he never use the same power to heal the sickness in the body of James, it is because the moment you are righteous your deliverance is designed to come by light( revelational knowledge)`,

      "The knowledge that comes from the tree of life which is the knowledge that make you to know what you have that you didn't know, because when God created you, he had already put everything you need to survive inside you and around you, there is a treasure in your earthly vessel.",

      "But once you begin to feed on wrong knowledge which is the knowledge of good and evil it will begin to open your eyes to what you need that you don't have, you will just keep on discovering that you are naked.",

      "And our academic school curriculum, life philosophies and ideologies is full of this dead knowledge.",

      "And that is the reason why we'll graduate with good result but can't do anything with that result than to be looking for who will employ us.",

      "Because all we want to learn in school is about how to get what you need that you didn't have, and this is what led many of us to run a rat race in life.",

      "True knowledge is the knowledge that open your eyes to see yourself, see what you have WITH you that you don't know and see what you have IN you that you don't know.",

      "I don't need to think that until i go out of the country before I will succeed, because everything I need to succeed is within me and is around me.",

      "Lack of true knowledge is just the inability to know what is in me and what is with me to get what I need in life.",

      "You are where you are not because of what you lack, you are where you are because you don't know WHAT you have. (lack of true knowledge)",

      "You are where you are not because of what you lack, you are where you are because you don't know HOW to use what you have. (lack of wisdom)",

      "Show me a seminar and conference that will open your eyes to what is IN you and WITH you, that you didn't know, then I'll show you a seminar that has just impacted you with true knowledge and wisdom that is true.",

      "True knowledge open you up to the resources available that you don't know and not resources needed that you don't have, because everything needed to solve your problems is not far from you.",

      "What you lack is not what keep you where you are, what you have that you didn't know is what keep you where you are.",

      "True light is the knowledge that open your eyes to what you have and didn't know.",

      "False light called darkness is the knowledge that open your eyes to what you lack that you didn't know, this is what Adam ate that brought problems to his life.",

      "You assumed, if i can just see #500,000 (five hundred thousand naira), my business will boom, who told you that money is what you need to grow business?",

       is what God used to create the Heaven and Earth.",

      "When God give you his Word and his Spirit, all he is telling you is to create all you need with it, that is the spiritual raw material God use to create the Heaven and Earth.",

      "The scripture say all things where made by the word.",

      "John 1:1-3 (NET)",
      "1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was fully God.",

      "2. The Word was with God in the beginning.",

      "3. All things were created by him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.",

      "And yet you have what God use to create Heaven and Earth and you can't use it to grow your business.",

      "No business grow by money, business grow by spirit, it grows by being sponsored by the agency of the spirit ask the children of darkness they know this truth.",

      "It is foolish people that attend seminar in the public places on how to grow business,  men who know the truth know how to attend seminar at the conference house of immortality to get Spirit code for their business.",

      "Let me show you a scripture.",

      "Hebrews 11:3",
      "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.",

      "This scripture say all thing that is visible was made by what is not visible.",

      "The secret behind any success in the visible realm is invisible.",

      "If you ask Dangote the secret of his visible success and he begin to point you to the visible things he did, he has not told you the truth.",

      "Because the scripture say all things that are visible are made by what is not visible.",

      "And that thing that is not visible that God use to create the Heaven and the Earth is already with and in you, His Spirit is IN you and his word (scripture) is WITH you.",

      "Meaning, the Word is no longer with God, the raw material needed to create all what you are asking God for is no longer with God, you can see why God cannot answer your prayer again,  the last time God answered the prayer of man was over 2000 years ago at Pentecost, because God has answered all the prayer of man before we will pray.",

      `Isaiah 65:24 “It shall come to pass That before they call, I will answer, And while they are still speaking, I will hear."`,

      "This scripture has been fulfilled, yet many didn't know, God is no longer in the business of you waiting for him to ask before he answer, in the realm of sonship, God answered before you ask.",

      "It wasn't Adam asking God  for wife before God gave him a wife, God made provision for wife before he thought of needing one. Get this, your provision is older than you, you have the solution to your problem with you before having the problems in you.",

      "If the Word was with God, but no longer with God, The question is where is now the Word? Where is now this spiritual raw material? The scripture say it is with you, the Word is now in your mouth, the spiritual raw material to create all things is now with you.",

      "Romans 10:8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith which we preach):",

      "That is the WORD was with God (john 1:1) but the word is now with you (Roman's 10:8)",

      "And yet ignorance is still making us to cry to God to do for us what he has giving us the raw material to create things for ourselves, permit me to tell you that God is helpless over your situation, because he has given you everything to help you already.",

      "Christians are like a nation blessed with crude oil and yet crying to God for petrol, all they need is wisdom on how to get petrol from crude oil, can you now see the reason why scripture told us that wisdom is the principal thing and with all thy getting get understanding,  because wisdom is all you need to discover what is available for you and how to bring out what you need from what God has made available for you.",

      "The simple problem of many of us is how to use this spiritual raw material to form all we need, the scripture say every thing visible was formed by this invisible raw material called the Word of God.",

      "Hebrews 11:3 By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.",

      "How can God bless you with what he use to frame the world and yet you are still the slave of the world.",

      "The children of darkness are blessed with the things of this world, we are now envying them, not knowing God has already blessed us with what he use to create the world, they have what the world produces called the things of this world, but we have what produces the world called the Word of God.",

      "But they look fortunate and we look unfortunate because we lack the knowledge of what God has blessed us with, we also lack the knowledge of how to get what we need from it.",

      "3. Spiritual Blessings",

      "The natural blessings are the natural resources and natural raw materials created for man by God, like the sun, water, Air, land, soil, crude oil among others.",

      "The material blessings are the good things of life created from natural blessing like car, houses, and many good things of this life.",

      "Why spiritual blessings are the spiritual raw materials God used to create Heaven and Earth.",

      "God didn't say i have blessed the Church with all materials blessing and natural blessings,  you don't need to be born again to have access to those blessing, God designed natural blessing (rain) to fall upon the roof of the righteous and the unrighteous.",

      "You don't need to be born again to have access to natural and material blessing, you only need to be born on Earth.",

      "But to get spiritual blessing that is in heavenly places you must be born again.",

      "You may now use the word to create healing for yourself and even create divine health for yourself.",

      "Can you now understand why God keep on saying he has sent his word to heal us, and to deliver us from our destruction.",

      "Because before the Word of God will begin to work for you, the Word of God with you must be in you.",

      "It doesn't take time for the Spirit of God to be in you, once you believe in Jesus and you receive eternal life, you have already received Holy Spirit, but it take time to get the Word of God with you to be in you.",

      "Because the first thing is that you must be loaded with the knowledge of the Word of God and for this purpose God raised teachers in the body of Christ so that they can help you take the Word of God with you (Scripture) and put it in you.",

      "The word of God is powerless once it is with you, but it become the most powerful raw material once it is in you.",

      "The moment you receive eternal life, and you receive eternal Spirit, all you need next is eternal light, once you got a light from the scripture by the help of the Holy Spirit  you have laid hold of the spiritual raw material needed to create what you need.",

      "Meaning in this kingdom what we have is an outcome of what we say,",

      "In the natural realm, what you have is an outcome of what you do, But in the spiritual realm where you belong, what you have is an outcome of what you say.",

      "It doesn't take time for men to confess, but to get the light in men , and that is the issue.",

      "Get this, If your confession is not a product of light, it is as empty as anything, but if your  confession is a product of light it is as powerful more than anything you can imagine.",

      "Get this, don't confess until you have secure a light, confession not sponsored by light is just mere religion.",

      "Christianity is not positive confession, positive confession without revelational light from the scripture can land you into confusions.",

      "Many of us will pray and be expecting things to happen, when God expect you to pray so that light can come and with that light you speak and then something happen.",

      "The scripture say if you have Faith like the mustard seed you can say to this mountain, not pray to God about this mountain, the strength of believer in this Earth is not praying, it is speaking.",

      "So the principalities that God brought your way to educate, they have already put you in bondage because you lack the light needed to educate them, so they are the one educating you now on how powerful they are, that is why all your teachings as a pastor is how devil has dealt with your life, you are now teaching people how powerful devil can be and you begin to put fear in them to pray very well and fast very well if they want to overcome warfare.",

      "The scripture didn't say at the mention of the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, he said in the Name of Jesus, every knee shal bow.(They are two different things)",

      "The Name of Jesus is not something you mention, it is something you enter, that name is a strong tower, the righteous enter into it and is safe.",

      "Freedom is all you need from the bondage of sickness, and the scripture say anywhere there the spirit of the lord is, there is liberty.",

      "Meaning when God was given you holy spirit He was given you liberty, so you have freedom, but because you didn't know, you are not free.",

      "If you know this by revelation, you will confess your freedom from sickness,poverty, lack, stagnation and you will have what you say.",

The race is not to the swift,
Nor the battle to the strong,
Nor bread to the wise,
Nor riches to men of understanding, Nor favor to men of skill; But time and chance happen to them all.`,

      "The scripture say clearly that it is the blessing of the lord that make one rich, without adding sorrow to it. Principles doesn't make anyone wealthy, it is power to make wealth that make one wealthy, and that power is not principles, the power is Spirit.",

      "The poor did not need seven keys to prosperity, Jesus is saying here that they need the gospel, the poverty need in them need to hear the Gospel.",

      "And this is the mystery of what Jesus plan to do, as we preach the Gosple of Christ to the poor, and the poor accept, then the poor himself will now preach the gospel to the poverty in him.",

      "And you must understand the language that those creatures can hear and that is the language of light, it is when you are speaking from the depth of light that they hear you.",

      "If you are sick, my assignment is to preach the gospel of healing to the sick once you believe, then the sick himself now preach the Gospel to the sickness.",

      "Firstly, John said he was in the Spirit and he heard behind him a loud voice as of the trumpet and the trumpet was saying I am the Alpha and the Omega.",

      "Meaning, the trumpet that sound was not blowing like Nigeria trumpet, the trumpet was talking, the trumpet was blowing a message not a sound.",

      "You are waiting for a trumpet that will blow a sound when the trumpet is already blowing a message and men who are in the Spirit are getting the message.",

      "They don't know that when scripture give prophecy, they are symbolic, the Angels that will blow the trumpet are some of us ordained by God to preach the Gospel of immortality, some of us ordained by God to be a steward of God's mystery.",

Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and STEWARDS OF THE MYSTERIES OF GOD.`,

      "There are some men walking on this Earth who are just servant of Christ doing great work for the kingdom, but there are some of us who are not just servant of Christ, we are steward and custodian of God's mystery, we belong to the lineage of paul, our books are designed to be storage of God's mystery kept for the age and generations coming.",

      "Show me who are literally waiting for the second coming of Jesus and trumpet again, i will show you those that will miss rapture that the trumpet has started blowing now, they will never believe it, they will never believe that the trumpet is a gospel, not Gospel of Salvation, not Gospel of Grace and Faith, But the Gospel of immortality.",

      "It is either your immortality is swallowed up by mortality or your immortality is swallowed up by mortality.",

      "This scripture is pointing to two dimensions of us we don't pay attention to.",

      "We mostly talk about the natural, supernatural and spiritual aspects of us those aspect is not what we use to swallow up death in victory.",

      "But this scripture begin to talk about incorruptible aspect of us, the immortality aspect of us, and the scripture through paul now say something that gives me sorrow in this scripture that even though in the realm of God, death has been swallowed up in victory.",

      "But Paul begin to say that this can't become reality in us until the corruptible part of us has been swallowed up by the immorality in us, until the corruptible has put on the incorruptible, paul said once this has happened then death is swallowed up in victory.",

      "The plan of God is that just as we grow our spiritual life so also we grow our Immortal life.",

      "And the message for this two are different, there are messages that grow our spiritual life why there are messages designed to grow our immortal life.",

      "The hidden wisdom of God which we communicate by mystery is what God designed to grow the immortality in us.",

      "Just as flesh is the opposite of Spirit so also biological life is the opposite of eternal life, the plan of God is for the life of God in us called the eternal life to swallow up the life of man in us.",

      "For instance if you are spiritual, you will not fufil the lust of the flesh, you will begin to manifest the fruit of the SPIRIT, like love, peace, joy, kindness among others.",

      "But you can be spiritual and still sick again, because spirituality only make you to overcome your carnal life not your natural life, you overcome the flesh but not the body.",

      "So both fruit of the Spirit and fruit of a natural man like sickness, weakness, death can be manifesting in your life at the same time.",

      "But when you grow your spiritual life and the fruit of the spirit and you also grow your immortal life, the fruit will be divine health, that is, the disease and the limitations of the natural body can't control you again, instead of sickness to come to your body and you die, sickness will come to your body and die, because you are carrying a life of God in this body.",

      "You stand in a circumstance without talking and the circumstances begin to change, because they are hearing the voice of your presence, this is when time become what you control and not what controls you.",

      "Jesus lived as a supernatural and spiritual man before he died, but when he resurrected, he begin to live as an immortal man, he live on Earth for days as an immortal man, he taught his disciples for 40 days as an immortal man things pertaining to the kingdom of God.",

      `Acts 1:3
To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:`,

      "Those things he taught his disciples was not recorded in the scriptures, Because they are strange things that a normal man cannot swallow.",

      "It it during this 40 days teaching that the immortality aspect of the disciples was able to grow, that is why you see Peter sleeping in prison when they took the head of James in his presence.( Act 12:1-6)",

      `Acts of the Apostles 12:6
[6]The night before Peter was to be placed on trial, he was asleep, fastened with two chains between two soldiers. Others stood guard at the prison gate.`,

      "How can you be in this condition at the valley of shadows of death and yet be asleep, What he displayed in that place is not a proof of spirituality, that is not a nature of spirituality, that is the nature of immortality.",

      "A spiritual man can still be afraid of death, no matter how spiritual you may be, you will be afraid of death, because the reality of spirituality does not capture the ability not to fear death, it only captures the ability not to fear tomorrow.",

      "The supernatural aspect of you enable you not to fear demons",
      "The spiritual aspect of you enable you not to fear tomorrow.",
      "The immortal aspect of you enables you not to fear death.",

      "Because there are natural aspect of man, supernatural aspect of man, spiritual aspect of man and immortal aspect of man, and there are food ordained to feed this four aspect of man.",

      "Literal food feed the natural aspect of man.",

      "Hearing the call of God and responding is the voice and word that wake and feed the supernatural aspect of us, once God called you into certain assignment and you respond he anoint you for that assignment, that gift and the anointing for his assignment is what make you supernatural.",

      `Acts of the Apostles 20:32
[32]“And now I entrust you to God and the message of his grace that is able to build you up and give you an inheritance with all those he has set apart for himself.`,

      "Why hearing the mystery of God, mystery of the kingdom and the hidden wisdom of God which we communicate in mystery is what you need to feed and grow the immortality aspect of us into manifestation.",

      "Because it take an immortal man to stand before death and be sleeping in peace like baby as Peter did in prison.",

      "Everything Jesus taught his disciples before his death is for their spiritual life, why everything he taught them after his resurrection which are things pertaining the kingdom of God not recorded, is for their immortal life, the power they waited for at Pentecost is for supernatural life.",

we teach thing pertaining to supernatural life which  your calling, So we teach things pertaining to your spiritual life also which is the message of Grace and Faith, we also teach things pertaining to your immortal life also which is the hidden wisdom of God we communicate in mystery that has been ordained for us before the foundation of the world, this is the message from the wisdom of the world to come.`,

      "Just as we have the power of the world to come, so also we have the wisdom of the world to come.",

      "And this wisdom of the world to come is what paul described as the hidden wisdom of God which we communicate in mystery.",

      "Why the hidden wisdom which we communicate in mystery are for our immortal life because the immortal life is governed by mystery, it survived by mystery, it grows by mystery.",

      "As a servant of Christ you feed the spiritual life of men and grow their spiritual life, you work as shepherd and men following you are like sheep.",

      "But as Steward of the mystery of God, you feed the immortality of people at the conference house of immortality, you work as custodian of God's mystery and men follow you as immortals.",

      "1. First, when he begin to talk about this hidden wisdom he said it is a wisdom that was ordained for us before the foundation of the world, that is, this are the kind of wisdom we could be eating how I wish Adam didn't fall, it is not a wisdom that contain how to get what we lack, but it is a wisdom that contain how to use what God has freely created for us to produce what we will give to others.",

      "There are wisdom we begin to feed ourselves with after the fall, which was not ordained for our glory, and the plan of God is that after you have been raised with Christ and have received eternal life, you must be introduced back to this wisdom, because the scripture say this wisdom is the main tree of life.",

      "That is why the scripture say truly happy are you when you found the wisdom, but happy are you also when you retain it.",

      "Meaning, when Adam was sent out of the garden of Eden and was prevented from eating the tree of life, that tree of life is wisdom, meaning God send Adam out of where he can feed from the wisdom of God.",

      "Now this is my question, if the scripture describe the tree of life to be wisdom, and God seperate Adam from that tree of life, meaning, for over 4000 years men was banned from accessing the hidden wisdom of God until christ who is the wisdom came again.",

      "They will pay attention and yet they will not understand, the scripture didn't say our light will overcome darkness, he didn't say darkness will not be able overcome it, the emphasis of that scripture is that darkness will not understand it.",

      "It is light when it is given to darkness and darkness cannot comprehend it.",

      "Someone say do darkness have intelligence to comprehend?",

      "Yes, they can comprehend, if you argue that it means you don't know darkness.",

      "If the scripture say we are the light of the world, it means men also are the darkness of the world.",

      "Meaning, darkness are human beings!",

      "And the scripture say this human beings called darkness they will not be able to comprehend what we are saying.",

      "The scripture say a natural man no matter how you explain to them, they cannot comprehend the things of the Spirit.",

      "So if a natural man now come to your church and begin to pick sense and understanding from what you are saying then what you are releasing is not light, it is not spiritual things.",

      "You are only speaking into the intelligence and sense of man, you are not speaking to their Spirit.",

      "There are men of God that all they do is to speak into the intelligence and sense of man, they claim they are called to minister to educated people.",

      "But when God give you a message, you are to speak into the Spirit of man, in this realm your education has no advantage, you can be a professor and know nothing about the mystery of the kingdom and you can be an illiterate in terms of academic standard of this world and know much about the mystery of the kingdom.",

      "That is why you can't use explanation of the message of the kingdom to bring anyone into Salvation, it must be light of the gospel that will enter into their heart and make them come to the knowledge of Christ, it is not by much persuasion of eloquence that lead to conviction, it is an encounter with light that lead to conviction.",

      "That is why we don't try to explain beyond the Grace given to us, because there are people that will never come to the understanding of what you are saying even though you use Heaven and Earth to explain, because it has not been given to them to know the mystery of the kingdom.",

      `Luke 8:10 And He said, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is given in parables, that
‘Seeing they may not see,
And hearing they may not understand.’`,

      "Meaning knowing the mystery of the kingdom is a gift, there are level of spiritual intelligence that must be given to you by God to comprehend it, just as teaching the mystery of the kingdom is a gift, you must be a steward of Gods mystery to teach it, so also knowing it is a gift, you must have some level of spiritual intelligence to know it.",

      "I am only ordained by God to write to those whom have been given to know the mystery of the kingdom.",

      "And if you don't belong to that lineage God only speak to you in parables and limit you to the open wisdom of God, so all what God is teaching you for 20 years is the message of holiness and righteousness, all your message is about attacking the wrong of everyone and correcting the right of everyone and you called it holiness message.",

      "When you are ready to build the immortality in you to manifestation, you will see God bringing you across messages that contain the hidden wisdom of God which we communicate in mystery.",

      "Because no man become immortal until he have encounter with the mystery of the kingdom, until he encounter the message of men who are stewards of the mystery of God.",

      "Get this, it is only what spirit teach you to know that you can use to fulfil purpose and destiny in life.",

      "Show me the information in your hand, if it is the information given to you by your spirit or by the Spirit of God, I will tell you that such information is truth, because there're education and information put in you by the system of this world or ideology of this life and they are your enemy.",

      `Job 32:8 But there is a spirit in man,
      And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.`,

      "The scripture says there is a spirit in man that know the things of man, he also mentioned the Spirit of God that know the things of God.",

      "Meaning, behind every knowledge there are Spirit.",

      "1. And we have the spirit of man that help you to know the things of man.",

      "2. We have the Spirit of God that help you to know the things of God.",

      "3. We also have the Spirit of this world that help you to know the things of this world.",

      "And the spirit of this world is so organized to the extent that they now have a formalised systems through which you can know the things of this world and they call it academic school, they now told you that if you don't know the things of this world you are taught in higher institutions, you can never become something in life. (And this is the first stronghold you must put down to fufil God's purpose in life)",

      "And after teaching you the things of this world, they give you certificate for learning and they tell you that certificate is your life, that is, your life depend on that certificate they gave to you (they cage your life in a paper and give it to you)",

      "I am just showing you how the power of darkness is ruling many lives.",

      "So now, we don't allow our spirit to educate us, and the Information loaded in our Spirit is about the things of man, so we don't explore that realm, we know nothing about the things of man and that is why we fall into many sickness that we now think the solution provided by education from the spirit of this world is to solve the sickness.",

      "We don't know that if we allow the spirit in man to educate us about the things of man, there are sicknesses that can never manifest in us, even though we don't have Holy Spirit.",

      "There are strange wisdom embedded in this our human Spirit that we can explore and begin to live like immortal even without the Holy Ghost.",

      "Have you not seen men who know how to use the power of medications and begin to speak some strange wisdom about this life and yet they are not born again?",

      "These are men who have mastered how to use their spirit and you begin to see them speaking the things of man, many of our local food we are eating in Nigeria are product of wisdom from our human spirit. How do men got to know that you can bring out red oil out of palm tree, bring out garri out of Cassava, how do they discover those wisdom?  It is because there is a Spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty give those spirit understanding.",

      "Because those food are things of man, and it is only the Spirit of man that knows the things of man.",

      "Who are the people that form the dialect and language of your community, I just grew up to discover i can speak yoruba, who are the people that formed that language and they mastered it and make it a means of communication, all this are the capacity embedded in the spirit of man.",

      "But there is a spirit called the god of this world and his assignment is to promote a civilisation that is darkness, that civilisation look as exposure but they are only opening our eyes to our nakedness, it make you to see the knowledge pertaining to things of man as old school and make you to see the knowledge pertaining to things of God as foolishness and now make you to see the knowledge pertaining things of this world to be civilisation.",

      "Can I shock you, the Holy Spirit  didn't come to teach you the things of man, the assignment of the Holy Spirit is to teach you the things of God, why the assignment of the human spirit given to you is to teach you the things of man (And those are the two knowledge we are designed by God to need)",

      "Can you now understand why God say do not love the world neither the things that of the world, because everything in the world didn't come from the Father.",
      `
      1 John 2:15 Do Not Love the World
      Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.`,

      "1 John 2:16 For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world.",

      "That is, they didn't come from the spirit of God, they did not also come from the Spirit of man, they are things that come from the Spirit of this world.",

      "Loving the things that come from man is not a sin, loving the things that come from God is not a sin, but loving the things that come from this world make you an automatic enemy of God,",

      "There are men on this earth that didn't have human spirit, the spirit they have in their body as their human spirit didn't come from God, it is the spirit of this world, they are not human being created by God, salvation didn't belong to them, they are generation of vipers, the spirit of anti-God and anti-Christ is what is in them, they make the things of man and present it as old school and make the things of God and present it as foolishness and make the things of this world and present it as civilisation.",

      "They have strange understanding also, but it is not the inspiration of the Almighty sponsoring that understanding, because the spirit is them is not the spirit of man, it is the spirit of this world.",

      "Most of the things they created, it is not the inspiration of the Almighty that give them understanding, that is why God said everything they created didn't come from him.",

      "Look at the scripture again",

      "1 John 2:16 For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world.",

      "The scripture didn't say for all that is in the earth do not come from the father, the emphasise is about the things of the world.",

      "The things of the earth is different from the things of the world, the things of this earth are created for purpose to solve the need of man and we bought them for those good purpose, but the things of this world are created for pleasure and not for purpose, they are for the lust of the eyes, lust of flesh and pride of life.",

      "So there are cars for instance that are created by the spirit of man, and there are cars that are created by the spirit of this world, there are house built by the spirit of man and there are house built by the spirit of this world, so everything created by the spirit of this world are what the scripture describes as things of this world.",

      "Because they don't create things for purpose, they only create things for the pride of life, lust of the eyes and lust of the flesh, and people by their product didn't buy them for any reasonable purpose that have to do with the need of man, they are bought because of lust of eyes, lust of the flesh and pride of life.",

      "It is easy to know the difference between the things created by human Spirit by the inspiration of the Almighty and the things created by the Spirit of the god of this world, when the spirit of man create anything by the inspiration of the Almighty it is for purpose, it is to solve the problem of the need of man, but when the spirit of this world created their own it will never be for purpose, it will be for pleasure, for gratifying the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes and pride of life.",

      "And God's plan is for us to submit to our spirit to educate us concerning the things of man and submit to Holy Spirit to educate us concerning the things of God, but many of us now submit to the spirit of this world because all we want to know are not things of man and things of God but the things of this world.",

      "1 Corinthians 2:11 For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.",

      "1 Corinthians 2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God.",

      "When you look at that scripture very well, you will discover that three spirit was mentioned in that bible verse.",

      "1. The Spirit of man which enable you to know the things of man.",

      "2. The Spirit of God which enable you to know the things of God.",

      "3. The Spirit of this world which enable you to know the things of this world.",

      "Because spirit is the one behind every knowledge, and to get knowledge from any Spirit you must submit to that Spirit.",

      "Someone is saying how can I submit myself to my spirit to educate me about the things if man?",

      "And how can I submit to the Holy Spirit to educate me about the things of the Spirit.",

      "How can I also destroy the education I have received from the spirit of this world that have formed stronghold in my heart.",

      "The knowledge from the spirit of the world given to us is so that we can survive in life not so that we can fufil in life.",

      "95 % of the knowledge we gain from our high institutions are knowledge from the spirit of this world and it is to make you survive in life not to fufil in life' and the plan of God  for you is to provide for you things you will survive with without running after them so that you can focus on things you will fulfil with  as your run after them  because for that purpose you were born .( Mathew 6:25-32)",

      "When you are ready to begin to walk in the part of destiny then you will know that your teacher is already inside of you which is your spirit and all that the spirit need is the inspiration of the Almighty to give you understanding.  And  the manifestation of what your spirit taught you is what will begin to bring out your uniqueness in life.",

      "You are just like everybody in life if what you know is not the product of the inspiration of the Almighty given your spirit understanding.",

8But there is [a vital force] a spirit [of intelligence] in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives men understanding.`,

      "When the inspiration of the Almighty gives your spirit understanding, the understanding doesn't manifest as teaching ability, it manifest as talent, you will suddenly have the extra ordinary ability to do what a natural man cannot just do and in it lies your destiny assignment.",

      "Many of us build our life in the area of skill,rather than building ourselves in the area of our God given talent and gift, system of this world destroy our self image and make us to think it is on this earth you will learn what to do with your life , when you are born with what to do with your life.",

      "A farmer doesn't get to farm and be looking for farm tools to work, he came with his farm tools from home, so also everything you need to work in life can never be found in life, they can only be found in you, you came with it, they are not skills they are talent.",

      "All you just need is the inspiration of the Almighty, and just be following, I will show you how it come.",

      "Just as we working with the gift of the Holy Spirit need the quicken of the spirit to flow and manifest,so also those working with talent need inspiration of the Almighty to give their spirit understanding.",

      "Talent is the manifestation you see when the inspiration of the Almighty give your human spirit understanding.",

      "And you ask him how did he get this song? And he told you that the inspiration just came.",

      "He can't explain where the inspiration came from, the fact is that it came from God, inspiration is not only for those born again, it is for everyone created by God, once you have human spirit you can be inspired.",

      "You only need to be born again to be quicken by the Spirit but you don't need to be born again to be inspired by the Almighty.",

      "That is why you will agree with me that even though they are not born again they still acknowledge God even in the song, they may hold alcoholic wine in that song yet still mentioning the name of God.",

      "Someone is saying can God now give someone inspiration to sing a song that is not godly? It is just the nature of his mind that convert the inspiration into ungodly song, the human spirit of every natural man is innocent and that is where inspiration do business with, but because their mind is corrupt they convert their talent to promote what is not godly.",

      "Someone is saying why can't God stop giving the inspiration because he is not using it for God, get this, inspiration is not given to you to use it for God, it is given to you to use it for men, it is to use it  on matter pertaining the things of man, and secular songs is part of the things of man.",

      "Get this, secular Songs is different from worldly song, inspiration of the Almighty can never give you inspiration to sing worldly song, it is the spirit of the world that give you inspiration to sing worldly song.",

      "There are songs that are secular, they are not worldly and they are not godly but they are good, they pass some moral message, any reasonable person can listen to it, that is what the scripture refer to as things of man, and there is a spirit in man that can sponsored such act by the inspiration of the Almighty.",

      "Because the spirit of every natural man cannot deny the existence of God, they may not believe in Jesus because the light of the Gospel has not come to them but deep within them they believe in God.",

      "That is why you don't necessarily need the Holy Ghost to get inspiration, once your human spirit is from God that spirit is qualified for the inspiration of the almighty and by that he can know the things of man, you only need to be born again to know the things of God.",

      "Inspiration of the Almighty is not what give you understanding of the things of God, the spirit of wisdom and revelation is what do, and what that spirit do is to open the eyes of your understanding, it doesn't give you understanding, but he open the eyes of your understanding by light and it is the entrance of the scripture that give that light.",

      "You can see the difference.",

      "To know the things of God, your human spirit is a disadvantage, you must receive a new spirit, you must be born by the Spirit.",

      "For instance, I receive revelation about the things of God from the Holy Ghost but it is the spirit of man in me  that enables me to communicate it in a language that man will understand, the new spirit in me doesn't understand earthly language, he only understand heavenly language.",

      "The revelation is the things of God and no man can know the things of God except the Spirit of God.",

      "I don't need inspiration if I am dealing with God, but I need inspiration when dealing with man.",

      "I only need revelation to know what to say, but I need inspiration to say what I know.",

      "What to say comes by gift, why how to say it is a talent.",

      "That is the role of eloquence in teaching ministry and vocabulary in writing ministry.",

      "Some have inspiration on how to talk but they don't have revelation on what to say.",

      "Some also have revelation on what to say but they don't have inspiration on how to say it.",

      "You communicate it effectively as a teacher and write effectively as a writer when you have both revelation on what to say from the Holy Spirit and have inspiration on how to say it from your Spirit.",

      "And your Spirit only manifest base on your talent.",

      "If you don't have the talent to write for instance, you can't receive inspiration to write.",

      "Inspiration of the Almighty only come in the area of the capacity of your human spirit.",

      "Our human spirit have different capabilities, for instance the capacity of my human spirit is to write, why the capacity of your human spirit is to sing.",

      "So if the inspiration of the Almighty come to both of us, it will give me understanding to write and give you understanding to sing.",

      "So the same message both of us receive it by revelation if it is the things of God. I may now write my own as book by inspiration why you sing your own as songs by inspiration.",

      "Many of us are living another person's life, fake life, photocopy life because we don't explore our human spirit.",

      "You can never be your original self until you submit yourself to your spirit to educate you and bring the originality out of you.",

      "So know the strength of your spirit, there are area of things in man that your spirit know much about, all you need to do is to let the inspiration of the Almighty give your Spirit understanding in those area.",

      "Someone is asking how can I let the inspiration of the Almighty be flowing consistently?",

      "It is not by prayer, all you need is to put all your mind in just one things that your spirit can do best, man was not created by God to do many things in life, your spirit is designed just for one major capacity, you can use your mind to develop many skills, but your spirit is carrying just one singular capacity, he was given to you just for one purpose, that is why you can't be a jack of all trade and be master of anything in life, God designed your human spirit to be known just for one thing in life, that is why inspiration of the Almighty is far from a divided heart, a man whose heart is not single.",

      "It is when your heart is single that your body will be full of light.",

      "You may have many gifts of the Spirit, when you encounter the Holy Ghost, but i am talking of the nature, capacity and making of your human spirit.",

      "One thing that the spirit of this world successfully did to many of us that make us to lost the capacity of our spirit is that he separate our mind from our spirit so our mind is now in secular education because your mind has be programmed that without it you can never succeed in life.",

      "I tell you this today, WAEC certificate is all that everyone one of us need, that is enough to give us literal and basic education we need to communicate in the society.",

      "Every other education you need is in your Spirit.",

      "If you claim you need chemistry, the question I ask you is that the first person that wrote chemistry text book which book did he read.?",

      "Many of the theories we are studying in school was formed by men who didn't go to school but got educated from the spirit in them.",

      "I repeat the highest education we need from the spirit of this world is WAEC certificate to afford us to communicate with one another and relate well.",

      "Why the rest, you need the education from your spirit to teach you the things of man why you need the education from the Holy Ghost to teach you the things of God.",

      "1. The slavery by force is the slavery practice by the Babylonians, it is a situation whereby the armed forces of Babylonians will forcefully come to your community and invade the citizens to their community and enslave you under them and this is the way Daniel, Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego got to the land of Babylon  ( Daniel 1:1-10) and this also was once practiced by some European countries in centuries past which led them to come to Africa and took people into slavery, their mission is to put your body into slavery.",

      "2.The slavery by possession is the slavery practice by demons whereby they come into your house (your body) and take possession of you in your own (house) and forcefully make your spirit to submit to them in your own land and house, their mission is to put your spirit in slavery, and since your body is the house of your spirit so they come to your body and take over your spirit in your body.",

      "3. The last kind of slavery which is slavery by influence is the one practice by Roman Empire, their approach is totally different from the Babylonian system and style of slavery, the Roman kind of slavery will not come to you as enemy, they don't come for war, they came as someone to help, they came as saviour, they study what you lack and come in with help to solve your problem and once they win your heart by buying it, they begin to use the power of influence to cage your thoughts and reasoning and begin to make you to reason like them, they will not take you out of your land because they didn't come to enslaved your body, they will not forcefully possess you in your land because they didn't come to enslave your spirit but they keep you in your mind because their assignment is to enslave your mind.",

      "They deceive you that ignorance is what keep you where you are so they have knowledge to deliver you, but you didn't know that the knowledge they came with which they called education is what they want to use to enslave your mind.",

      "It is you that will now be willingly to submit to their education because you want to be like them.",

      "You willingly enter into life mental slavery when you begin to learn to be like others rather than learning how to be your real self, they become what they become by their own knowledge and once you want to become like them, you will have to submit to that their own knowledge, and this is the evil called civilisation and education that keep Africa to this backward stage of life.",

      "They deceive you that you are where you are base on the way you think and they are ahead of you because of the way they think, so they will now begin to make you think like them.",

      "Rather than making you to think the way God want you to think by submitting you to Holy Spirit and holy scripture or think the way you should think by submitting you to your spirit and inspiration,but they will now begin to make you to think the way they are thinking and to achieve that they submit you to the spirit of the world system.",

      "You begin to talk like them, act like them, and dress like them, you place their own language above your language, their language become compulsory subject you must pass why your own original language become optional and in the cost of doing this, we lost our originality and once our originality is lost, our spirit becomes inactive, inspiration of the Almighty can't do business with you again.  Just showing you why we are far from creativity in Africa.",

      "The only force behind creativity is inspiration, look at the meaning of inspiration yourself.",

      "Inspiration: the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something, especially to do something creative.",

      "Nothing invisible is stimulating in our mentality once your mind is cage.",

      "They are not mentality enslaved and that is why you see them growing in strange technology and creating different things, everything they create by inspiration they now bring them to us and begin to teach us how to repair them and we called that skills.",

      "Creative and creating ability is a talent why maintaining and repairing abilities is a skill, and they make us to focus on skills rather than focusing on talent.",

      "This is called mental slavery, and this is what African is suffering from now that we need deliverance.",

      "We have three kind of slavery.",

      "We have physical slavery and this is when you are physically captured by another man.",

      "We have spiritual slavery, and this is when you are possessed by demons.",

      "We have mental slavery, a situation whereby you can't think for yourself again, where by a system designed how you should think, and any attempt to break out from that thought to think for yourself will cost you what they want to offer you, it is when Chinese broke out of this mental slavery that they become outstanding in life.",

      "Your creativity is restored once you can break out of mental slavery, the major things the spirit of the world did is to separate your spirit from inspiration, all that your spirit need is inspiration of the Almighty.",

      "Independent is when you are physically free, deliverance is when you are spiritually free, why Salvation is when you are mentally.",

      "Because Salvation have to do with soul and mind, it is a deliverance of your soul, which bring you out of your former way of thinking into new way of thinking, from the way the world system has programmed you to think to the way you should think.",

      "That is why repentance is not change of behaviour, repentance is changing the way you think.",

      "And this mandate of mental deliverance of African was given to the body of Christ and we ourselves have been mentally enslaved even though we are shouting Salvation by mere confession.",

      "What govern the thought of many of us is not scripture, not light of the word of God, that is why we cannot follow Mathew 6:33 even though we are reading it day and night.",

      "And you now see them saying the first is to be a graduate and we discover that we wasted like 16 years of our life leaning how to be slave and civil servant.",

      "Because the first 6 years in primary school, with the second 6 years in secondary school couple with 4 years in the university that make it 16 years and we graduate and be looking for who to employ us.",

      "Meaning we have been trained to be an educated servant, you can see how the slavery has been well packaged.",

      "If any education can't make you a job creator but make you a job seeker then you have just wasted your destiny all in the name of being a graduate, your life that suppose to be in your spirit is now in a paper called certificate and you are now carrying your destiny about and attached the photocopy of that your destiny with a CV and you are submitting it to company who will employ you as their servant and pay you at the end of the month.",

      "Since you don't know what to do with your time and brain you now submit to a system who will take the time and brain  from 6am to 6pm and pay you for it at the end of the month, and you called it white collar job, they put a suicide roap on us and call it tie and that you must wear to the place of interview.",

      "Once of the greatest gift given to us by God is the gift of time and gift of brain, all you just need is gift of inspiration that will make your brain to be creative and make you to use your time for the purpose why you are born on Earth, if you know that 100 years is not enough to fufil the purpose why you are born on Earth then you will know that you don't have time in life.",

      "Certificate is something to be hanged in your workshop or office to let people know that you are a professional in what you are doing.",

      "Real education are all those one leaning fashion designer, have you never see anyone using fashion designer certificate to look for job, all they do is that after the training they get tools and materials for work, get a space for work and begin their work, if you see them working for others it is because they are looking for money to get tools to start working for themselves, not necessarily looking for money to survive.",

      "That is how education should be, how i wish we have not mentally put to slave in Africa, Western education is our greatnest enemy, until we are free from it, no prayer can free us.",

      "Because scripture didn't tell us that prayer is our weapon of warfare that is not carnal use to destroy stronghold, what destroy stronghold is the information you are getting from this Banjo Ayeka's DIARY.",

      "Light from your spirit sponsored by the inspiration of the Almighty or light of the Holy Ghost sponsored by Revelation  from the scripture is the only force that destroys stronghold.",

      "I am not in any way against education but I am 100% against African academic system.",

      "It is what the god of this world use to put us into mental slavery.",

      "Suffering is when you are mentality free and physically enslaved.",

      "Torment is when you are physically enlaved and spiritually enslaved.",

      "And frustration and confusion is when you are physically free and mentally enslaved, and when the problem of frustration and confusion is not solved the outcome is suffering.",

      "A situation whereby you don't know what to do with your life, it is after your NYSC that it will done on you that you have never walk in the pathway of destiny, we are not focus, we are not man of one thing, we are Jack of all trade and master of nothing.",

      "If you can dedicate all your mind on a certain thing, you begin to see the inspiration of the Almighty giving you understanding in that thing, and an enslave mind can never and never be focused.",

      "This is the mystery behind every of my book.",

      "In most cases I force myself to stop writing on any book.",

      "If I am writing a book for instance on prayer, all I do is that all my mind will be on prayer, I don't think of anything again outside prayer and by that inspiration will begin to come on prayer, I may end up writing two books on prayer within a month.",

      "I don't write because I read, I write because I think much, my thoughts are single, readers are not necessarily writers, thinkers are writers.",

      "My thoughts is not enslaved, I don't buy into the ideology of this world, I am in a warfare with it, I don't do things because every one is doing it, and the weapon of my warfare that is not canal but mighty in pulling down the stronghold in my mind is scripture (the word of God is the sword of the spirit for such warfare)",

      "I don't reason the way everyone reason, that is why people think i am a controversial writer, because I will question everything in line with scripture, that it is generally acceptable doesn't make it the truth, that every general overseer are doing it doesn't make it correct.",

      "I treasure my spirit, I will not allow you to use one ideology of this world to cage me, because I know the implications, they are ideology that kill the creativity in us and just make one to follow it the way they are doing it, without questioning why we should do it that way.",

      "And this slavery spirit bring us into body of Christ and again make many general overseers to begin to brainwash us, none of us can question the doctrine of tithing as key to prosperity even we know it is unscritpural because Christ has become poor so that through his poverty we might be rich not so that through tithing we might be rich.",

      "Inspiration is very easy to tap if you can make your mind single, once your thoughts is free from slavery and you are ready to listen to the education of your spirit, inspiration of the Almighty will begin to give you understanding.",

      "And if I want the inspiration to stop flowing, if I am writing anything all I do is to take my mind of what I am writing and put it on another topic again.",

      "Infact in most cases it takes me enough self control not to be changing every topic in this Banjo Ayeka's DIARY into parts, series and book, every daily topic are book on their own, all I will just do is to keep on meditating and thinking of that topic and with pen in my hand and before 6 hours I have written over 100 pages of book on that same topic.",

"Get this whenever you want the inspiration of the Almighty to come, study Nature. why whenever you want the revelation of the Almighty to come study the scripture.",

"That is why men who wrote the scripture are men who study nature.",

"Because nature contains the truth about God more than scripture, that may the too hard for you to believe.",

"That is why the scripture say.",

`Romans 1:20
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:`,

"Look at another scripture again",

 ` Psalms 19:1 
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.`,

`Psalms 19:2
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.`,

"So it is not only in scripture that you see the hand work of God alone, when you study nature you see physically the hand work of God.",

"That is you can study nature and know the eternal power of God, because the scripture say in that Roman's 1 vs 20 that even the eternal power of God can be understood by things that are made.",

"You felt until you study the book ot Act you can't see the move of the spirit, when you study the sky and seas you can also see the move of the spirit.",

"Get this, you must be able to understand the difference between what God wrote by himself and what God use men to write.",

"The holy book which is bible is a book that God use men to write and the scripture say all scripture is talking about Christ.", 

"Why nature is the visible handwriting of God writen by God himself, everything God created is communicating  something about eternity, and you can study God through them.",

"Scripture is like when God use letter to communicate why nature is like when God use picture to communicate.",

"That is why when Jesus want to begin to reveal his true identity, he was referring us to nature, you see him saying I am the light of the world, meaning jesus is telling you to close your bible and begin to study light, just as he was using scripture to explain himself, he was also using nature to reveal himself.",

"Infact when Jesus want to give us the explanation of the nature of the kingdom of God, he could not see any scripture to explain his understanding, all he begin to do was to relate the kingdom with nature , and he said the kingdom of God is like..",

`Luke 13:18.
Then He said, “What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?`,

"Luke 13:19 It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and put in his garden; and it grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.”",

"When David begin to write that who is men that you are mindful of and the son of man that you visited.",

`Psalms 8:4 What is man that You are mindful of him,
And the son of man that You visit him?`,

"We never read from verse 2 to study what brought that inspiration,",

"The scripture say it was when he was studying stars and Heavens.",

`Psalms 8:3 When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,
The moon and the stars, which You have ordained,`,

"Psalms 8:4 What is man that You are mindful of him,And the son of man that You visit him?",

"That is when he begin to meditate on heaven suddenly the inspiration of the Almighty came and he begin to write, it was not scripture he was studying, he was studying nature to write scripture.",

"We studied scripture to write spiritual books, why they studied nature to write the scripture we are studying,",

"If I begin to studying nature to write, quote nature to write, the religious nature in us  we say Banjo Ayeka's Diary is not spiritual, he never even quote scripture for once,",

"We study the scripture to write revelation, but men wrote scripture never wrote it by revelation, they wrote it by inspiration.",

"That is why the scripture say all scripture was written by the inspiration of the Almighty, not writen by revelation,",

"2 Timothy 3:16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,",

"because at the time they where written, the spirit of revelation was not yet in existence.",

"Because revelation came when you are trying to study God through the scripture or through spiritual material why inspiration come when you are trying to study nature, that is why the new testament was writing by revelation of the Almighty why the old testament was written by the inspiration of the Almighty.",

"So when Paul was saying all scripture was written by the inspiration of the Almighty, he wasn't talking about Mathew to Jude, he was referring to Genesis to Malachi, because at the time he was written 2nd Timothy there was no new testament writing.",

"So if the scripture say all scripture was written by the inspiration of the Almighty, it mean scripture was written by men who study nature to know God.",

"I share this secret to you today, if you want to be a good writer, either songs writer, script writer or book writer just learn to gaze your mind on the reality of life , activities of life and nature under heaven , you will suddenly begin to see the inspiration of the Almighty given you understanding about life, nature, and activities under the heaven, this is the mystery behind the expression of wisdom of Solomon that he wrote as scripture which now become what we study as scripture and get revelation from it.",

"Ecclesiastes 1:13 And I set my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven; this burdensome task God has given to the sons of man, by which they may be exercised.",

"You can kindly see what Solomon said he was studying, he set his heart to seek and search not scripture but activities done under the heaven.",

"Kindly look at another scripture again.",

`Ecclesiastes 9:11 I returned and saw under the sun that—
The race is not to the swift,
Nor the battle to the strong,
Nor bread to the wise,
Nor riches to men of understanding,
Nor favor to men of skill;
But time and chance happen to them all.`,

"He said he returns and saw under the sun, and he begin to write what he saw under the heaven by inspiration and what he wrote become scripture for us.",

"There is one thing to study nature to know nature and there is another thing to study nature to know God.",

"Those that study nature to know nature are the one that wrote Geography and Biology by the inspiration of the Almighty.",

"Those that study nature to know life are the ones that become philosophers and they write many books and have many wise sayings that contain wisdom for life and this is the origin of many of our Africa's proverbs.", 

"Why those that study nature to know God are the one that write scripture by the inspiration of the Almighty.",

"So you can study nature to know nature and bring out the benefits of nature to man.",

"You can study nature to know life also and bring out wise Proverbs by them.",

"Why you can also study nature to know God and know the will of God for man.",

"I don't know how to say it but the fact is that if you want to know God the Father, scripture is your greatnest disadvantage why nature is a your greatest advantage.",

"Because scripture didn't contain much about the revelation of God the Father, the scripture contain much about the revelation of God the judge and God the master, that is why he Give law to them as Judge and give commandments to them as Master , but he never give Grace to them as father, so old testament never reveal God the father know as the God of all Grace.",

"That is why you discover that whenever Jesus want to reveal the nature of God the Father to his disciples you see him pointing them to the earthly Father and learn from it, you see him pointing them to birds to learn from it.",

"You see him saying if your earthly Father can do this, how much more your heavenly Father.",

`Matthew 7:11  (NLT)
So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.`,

"Many in the church struggle to understand God the Father and relate with him as son to Father because they don't have much reference from the scripture that capture that reality.",

"They still carry the mentality of the fearful consuming fire who can kill them for doing wrong, the image of God they have in their mind is the one they see in the picture of the scripture.",

"I don't know if you are fortunate to have a lovely parent from your childhood till you grow up now, how did they treat you? Even as you grow up? If you can study that, it is enough revelation to capture the nature of God the Father.",

"Because Jesus keep on saying if your earthly Father who is evil can know how to love you this way, how much more your heavenly Father.",

"I find it easy to relate with God as my Father because I was fortunate to have a lovely Father when he was alive.",

"My parent trust God for years for the fruit of the womb before given birth to us, so when God answered their prayers, and they begin to have us, we so much enjoy their love and care.",

"My Daddy has bought my school bag when my mother was still having me in her belly, my parent put us to the best private school in the environment in the early 90's, we grow up to enjoy the good things of life until he died and we entered into suffering.", 

"Having tasted the two side, having a Father and been without Father then I understand people who live under the old testament without having God as Father and we under the new covenant who have God as Father.",

"It is ignorance of the highest order to begin to study how God relate with the people of the old testament and think that is how God will relate with you, God relate with them as a Boss relate with his Staff in the place of work , why God relate with you as a father to his children at home.",

"Truly the man is a boss and also a father, but he is a boss not to you but to his servant at work, why he is a father to you.",

"Truly God can be many things, he can be Master and Judge, but He is not my master and He is not my judge, He is my Father.",

"I repeat again that God is not my judge, Jesus already said that.",

"John 5:22 For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son,",

"So I don't approach My Heavenly father with fear, because I know he can never and will never judge me for doing wrong, he may chastise me with his word but not judge me, that is why I come to his throne with boldness because I know mercy Is sure for men and grace is also sure banker.",

"They are servant and God is a Master to them, why you are son and God is Father to you, they are two different Things.", 

"What God have in store for them was reward based on their service and obedience to God their Master.",

"Why what God have in store for you is inheritance based on your growth.",

"Just as my earthly Father trust  God for children for years before they give birth to us and that lead them to take care of us with much love so also Your heavenly father's was barren for 4000 years before he begin to us as children.",

"Since Adam to John the Baptist, God have servants, slaves, both in Heaven and Earth, but God never have son but suddenly Jesus become the first begotten son and open the womb of the Spirit for us and God begin to have us as children.",

"So the way God will relate with you will be different, no scripture captures the dimension of God's love for us.",

"The scripture say how deep and wide the love of God is for us.",

`Ephesians 3:18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height
Ephesians 3:19 to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.`,

"What is the point, if you really want to know God study nature also, not only scripture but nature and not only nature but scripture also.",

"Have you observed that how do men who didn't have scripture in the old testament know God.",

"That scripture in your hand was written by men who doesn't study scripture, they didn't study scripture and yet they know God, all they do was to study nature and by it they begin to encounter different dimensions of supernatural and angelic visitations.",

"Infact they know God more than us.",

"How do I know? Because they did exploits more than us.",

"Because the scripture say those who know their God shall be strong and do exploit.",

"If you claim you know God show me the exploits.",

"You may know scripture and not know God and you may not know scripture and know God.",

"Nature is loud about the voice of eternity more than scripture.", 

"Devil can use scripture to deceive, he can quote it wrongly to deceive you and put you in bondage but devil can't use nature to deceive, nature is like a voice so audible to the deaf and visible to the blind, you may quote scripture out of context and lead to arguments but you cannot quote nature out of context, instantly it will reveal your level of ignorance and foolishness.",

"How do men fall victim of the scripture that told them that if they don't pay tithe God will curse them and close the window of heaven on them.",

"You believe such wrong interpretation because you don't study nature.",

"Because if you and me know how to study nature to know God, we'll know the truth.",

"I will advise you to ask that your pastor that can he do that to his son?",

"If he has the key of Heaven at hand can he close it on his own son because he refuse to pay tithe?",

"Can you lay a curse on your son by yourself if he refuse to pay tithe?",

"If you can't do that base on your love for him, how can you now foolishly think that God will lay curse on his children and close heaven on them because they didn't pay tithe.",

"But this is the scripture that has been in church doctrine for years.",

"It is because we study scripture and we don't study nature.",

"I say this to you clearly that if all we have to study to know God is nature, the church could have been more United that studying scripture alone to know God.",

"We don't need scripture to tell you don't marry two wives, nature is enough, no one came out from polygamy that will advice his enemy to marry two wives.",

"You don't need scripture to teach you don't fornicate, before christianity came to Nigeria nature through culture has been teaching that already.", 

"It was a shameful thing in the ancient day to marry and you are not a virgin, yet they know it to be wrong without scripture.", 

"Mind you, they don't have scripture teaching them, but they have nature teaching them.",

"Kindly look are what paul says",

"Romans 2.14-16, “For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.",

"So don't think if we don't have scripture how can we live holy, sir we will even be more holier because men without law can by nature do what the law says without having the book of the law.",

"Because they know that nature can teach and they have master how to listen to the voice of God through nature, personally my life begin to have direction in life when I master how to hear the voice of nature.",

"I suffer direction for long because I don't know where God want me to be, how will I know if God want me to be in Lagos or Abuja, been a teacher that scripture is much primarily way of direction, scripture which is my strength can't help me, because there is no Lagos and Abuja in scripture and I dont trust the thought of my heart because I know that is the strength of religious spirit who usually pretends as Holy Spirit and lead man into fustraction all in the name of Holy Spirit speak to me.",

"And since dream is not also my strength I could not take advantage of it to know where God want me to be, but when I master how to hear the voice of nature I begin to have direction in life.",

"Look at what Paul said again.",

"1 Corinthians 11:14 Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?",

"Meaning it is not only scripture that teach, nature also teach, get this everything nature is saying is what men wrote down in scripture by the inspiration of the Almighty.",

"I say this to you clearly that nature is loaded more than scripture, nature is more spiritual than scripture.",

"Nature contain the knowledge about God more than Scripture.", 

"And you get inspiration through nature more than scripture, you only get revelation from scripture to know and understand what men who by inspiration write in the scripture.",

"You can see that inspiration is higher than revelation.",

"Inspiration of the Almighty is a breathe, it is life.",

"Revelation of the Almighty is light.",

"And you get light from life.",

`John 1:4
In him was life; and the life was the light of men.",

"And you get life from Spirit, it is the Spirit that give life.`,

"When both of them died and got to the main reality of life which is the life after death, the rich man found himself in hell and the poor man found himself in Heaven, then the rich man began to beg father Abraham to send Lazarus to him with a drop of water, but the response of Father Abraham to him requires serious attention.",

"Abraham said to the rich man that in your life time you have received the good things of life while Lazarus receive evil things.",

"Luke 16:25 But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you RECEIVED YOUR GOOD THINGS, and likewise LAZARUS EVIL THINGS; but now he is comforted and you are tormented.",

"The good things the rich man received is not my issue, but the scripture says Larazus received evil things. Then, I begin to ask who gave him evil things. Secondly, if evil things was given to him why did he receive it?",

"Because the law of the spirit is that anything released into our life can either be accepted or rejected, spiritual realm is a realm that extremely respects the choice of man.",

"The problem many have in life is just the problem of receiving. They don't know how to receive and reject, they have the nature that rejects good things of life and receive evil things of life and this is also the nature of Lazarus.",

"Kindly look at the scripture very well.",

"Father Abraham said to the rich man that you have received your good things of life in time while Larazus received evil things.",

"Then I said to myself, it means there is nothing you have in life that is not a product of what you receive from the spirit, the scripture says no man can receive anything except it is given from the Heaven.",

`John 3:27
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.`,

"Get this and get this mystery today, it is not the devil that gives evil, no man can receive either evil or good in life except it is given by God, if God has not first cursed you, no one can do, you can't curse whom God has not cursed.",

`Numbers 23:8
How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?`,

"If you curse me and it comes to pass, that is a true report card that I am under the curse of God, because the scripture says no one can curse whom God has not cursed. If God has blessed someone and you curse him, you have just cursed yourself, because whosoever shall curse them shall be cursed and whosoever shall bless them shall be blessed.",

`Genesis 12:3
And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee........`,

"Whenever devil wants to curse you all he does is to make you to be under the curse of God first, and if he wants to make you to be under the curse of God he puts you under the law, because curse is everyone that is under the curse of the law.",

`Galatians 3:10
For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.`,

"The legal ground of the devil is the word of God upon your life, his strength is the negative word of God upon your life?",

"How did Christ spoil principalities and render them powerless? By fighting them? CAPITAL NO!!!",

"All that Christ did was to remove all the handwriting of ordinance in scripture written against us, that is Jesus counselled all the curse of the law upon us.",

"Colossians 2:14 having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.",

"Colossians 2:15 Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.",

"Because the attacking power of the devil is the written word of God spoken against us by God, because evil was created when God released negative words upon the life of man.",

"Can you now understand when God said I created evil not the devil?",

`Isaiah 45:7 I form the light and create darkness,
I make peace and create calamity;
I, the Lord, do all these things.’`,

"Saying devil is the one that created evil is giving him the glory and power he doesn't have. Devil can not create anything both good and evil. The assignment of the devil is to lead you to choose evil that God has created, and this is how Lazarus received his evil.",

"And how does devil do this? He makes you to be under the law rather than under faith and grace. He makes you to think you can use your righteousness to earn God's blessing. Nothing puts a man under the curse of God under new covenant than this.",

"The scripture says curse is everyone under the law. (Galatians 3:10)",

"Because the law attracts the wrath of God, if you want to attract the wrath of God upon your life and receive evil into your life without doing anything wrong just be under the law.",

`NKJV, Romans 4:15
because the law brings about wrath;`,

`Romans 4:15( NLT)
[15]For the law always brings punishment on those who try to obey it.`,

"Show me a man who will receive evil with his life even though he is praying against evil with his mouth, then I will show you a man under the law.",

"Just be following, I want to show you the mystery behind the poverty of Lazarus.",

"The scripture says Lazarus received evil, then I begin to ask myself who gave him evil, and the scripture says the rich man received the good things of life, them I said to myself who gave the rich man good things?",

"Get this clearly, no man can receives anything either good or evil except it is first given by the Lord, the scripture says the same God that makes evil also makes good and he sets before us good and evil, and under the old covenant you choose by works while under the new covenant you choose by faith.",

"Meaning, devil is not the one that makes evil, devil only make evil to manifest in your life, he is not the one that puts evil in your life, the curse of God is what puts evil in the life of any Man, while the curse of evil man is what makes evil to manifest in the life or any man. The blessing of the Lord is what makes good to come into the life of any man while the blessing of holy Men (priest) is what makes the blessing of the Lord to manifest in the life of any man. (we'll talk more on this in tomorrow devotional)",

"And the scripture now says and Lazarus received evil.",

"That it is given is not the issue, that it is received is the issue here.",

"Something can be given to you and you reject it. If good things can be rejected when it is given so also evil things can be rejected when it is given.",

"The scripture didn't say and Lazarus did anything wrong to receive the evil things, the only issue he has is that he doesn't know how to reject evil and receive good but he is very good in receiving evil and rejecting good.",

`That a sickness was given to you is not the issue, it was given to everyone of us.
That a poverty was given to you is not the issue, it was given to everyone of us, the issue is that you received it.`,

"To everything that manifest in your life either good or evil, you must be humble enough to accept that it is because you received it.",

"There is an aspect of you responsible for receiving in the realm of the Spirit. If you don't train that aspect to receive, God can give you your blessing for years and yet you will not know how to receive it, you will keep on thinking God has not blessed you. You didn't know that you are the one that didn't know how to receive the blessing that has been freely given to you since 2000 years ago.",

"When God wants to bless us with all spiritual blessinf, he didn't give it directly to us, he gave it directly to Christ so that we can get it through Christ.",

"Meaning, God has given us all the spiritual blessings since 2000 years ago. Your life only remains the same if you don't know how to receive what has been freely given.",

"Just be following, I am just showing you the mystery behind the poverty of Lazarus.",

"Look at the scripture very well.",

"The bible says when the rich man died he was buried but when Lazarus died he was taken to Heaven by angels.",

"Luke 16:20 But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate,",

"Luke 16:21 desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.",

"Luke 16:22 So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.",

"Verse 20 and 21 capture the life experience while verse 22 captures what happened to them immediately after they died, and the scripture says when the rich man died he was buried, he doesn't have any angel to carry him, but when Lazarus died an angel carried him to Heaven.",

"Meaning that an angel have been with him all through when he was alive, that is his angels for God's sake!",

"Meaning, the angels were watching him all through his suffering, and he could not do anything. What is that thing that will make your angels to fold his arms with your blessing and yet stay with you and not bless you with it, just to be waiting for you to die and he takes you to heaven, just to be comforted there , not to be crowned in heaven, but to be comforted?",

"Luke 16:25 But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is COMFORTED and you are tormented.",

"All the riches that Lazarus needed to live a good life was with the angels, but he was poor because he doesn't know how to receive good things.",

"Could it be that the riches that belong to him was what the rich man was spending? Because the rich man doesn't have any angel, he doesn't have spiritual backing, and has no riches of life that is not sponsored by Spirit. Then, how did the rich man become rich without angels and how did Lazarus become poor even with the gift of angels.",

"How could a man die in poverty and angels took him to Heaven and the rich man died in riches and went to hell?",

"Can I shock you? There is nothing you are asking God for that has not been given to you even before you ask.",

"But you lack the wisdom of how to receive good things available for you and reject evil things available for you.",

"Because just as good things are free because Christ has paid the price so also evil things are free because Adam paid the price. Evil is free based on one man's disobedience and blessing is free based on one man's obedience.",

`Romans 5:17-18
[17]For the sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to rule over many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and his gift of righteousness, for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man, Jesus Christ.`,

"[18]Yes, Adam’s one sin brings condemnation for everyone, but Christ’s one act of righteousness brings a right relationship with God and new life for everyone.",

"So all you need is to learn how to receive good things of life that comes through Christ and reject evil things of life that comes through Adam.",

"You can't tell me that the problem of Lazarus is disobedience, because if it is disobedience he can't make it to Heaven.",

"But the only problem he has is that he doesn't know how to reject evil when it was given to him and he doesn't know how to receive good that was given to him.",

"Now the question is how do you receive good things? It is by FAITH.",

"Romans 4:16 Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.",

"And how do you receive any evil thing? It is also by Faith.",

`The scripture said "Put on the shield of Faith that you will be able to quench all the arrows of the enemy.`,

"Ephesians 6:16 above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery arrows of the wicked one.",

"Meaning, the only problem of Lazarus is lack of Faith, it is by Faith you receive good things and it is by Faith you reject  any evil thing.",

"Evil things came to the life of Lazarus and he didn't have Faith to quench it, for him to die and go to the bosom of Abraham who was generationally rich on Earth means he doesn't have what made Abraham to be justified and blessed on Earth which is by Faith.",

"Romans 4:2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.",

"Good things was given to him and yet he doesn't have Faith to receive it. Once you come from the lineage of Abraham, good things have already been given to you even before you where born, because the blessing of Abraham is for him and his children's children.",

"The covenant of undeserved blessings begin with the lineage of Abraham where God bless you for Abraham's sake, that is not based on your obedience but based on the Faith of Abraham.",

"Once a blessing is undeserved, it is by Faith you receive it. Once an evil is also undeserved, it is by Faith you reject it.",

"Meaning, the evil that Lazarus received is an underserved evil, for him to make it to Heaven means he doesn't deserve every evil he manifests on Earth.",

"Because since we entered into the economy of Grace in the New Testament which is the dispensation of undeserved blessing, you must also know that devil will also come with his own package to put you under the law all in the name of righteousness and holiness just to ensure the evil that came from God through Adam manifest in your life.",

"Highest percentage of the problem many Christians are facing today is undeserved problem, undeserved sickness, and you don't use warfare prayer to fight against any undeserved evil that comes your way, you fight it, reject it and quench it by Faith.",

"Look at the scripture again he said we quench all arrow of the wicked one by faith, not some arrow but all arrows.",

`Ephesians 6:16
[16]In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil.`,

"That ignorance that is making you to kill arrow by warfare prayers is the one that wants to make you to die like Lazarus because you lack the revelational knowledge of how to reject evil that comes.",

"The scripture says by Faith, you quench all arrow, meaning, the arrow will come, you can't stop them from coming but you can quench them from manifesting if they come.",

"Meaning, the rich man understands how to receive good and reject evil while Lazarus understands how to receive evil and reject good.",

"Now, the question is why did the rich man land in hell if he has Faith to receive the good.",

"He landed in hell because he didn't use what he received by Faith to know those who didn't have.",

"The first question should be how did the rich man who doesn't have angel become rich in life?",

"How did the rich man now receive good? From God? No, he received good from the angels of Lazarus, he was enjoying the riches that belongs to Lazarus.",

"How? Just be following, I will show you from scripture in tomorrow devotional.",

    content: [
      "In the last devotional we discussed about the mystery behind to poverty of Lazarus, now the question is what is the mystery behind the prosperity of the rich man?",

"Now pay a close attention on this scripture.",

`Matthew 10:41 
He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward. And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.`,

`Matthew 10:42 
And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, assuredly, I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.`,

"Kindly look at these scriptures and let us take it one after the other.",

"In verse 41 the  scripture is saying that if you accept a prophet in the name of a prophet then you will receive the reward of the prophet, Meaning, the prophet has a reward, the gift of a prophet is different from the reward of a prophet.",

`He goes on to say again that if you receive the righteous for the sake of the name "righteous" then you have received the reward of the righteous, Meaning, the righteous has reward.`,

"That is, you can be unrighteous and yet you are receiving the reward of the righteous and yet the righteous himself is not getting any reward in life.",

"I will show you a mystery today why many you tag to be unrighteous are prospering in life and yet you who claim to be righteous are struggling in life.",

"It is because those sinners and the unrighteous men you see know how to receive the reward of the righteous.",

"Mind you they may enjoy the rewards of the righteous on Earth and still land in hell like the rich man, why the righteous on Earth can die like Lazarus and goes to hell because he doesn't know how to receive in life.",

"Get this no one is designed in life to live by his own reward, we are designed to live by another person's reward why others live by your own reward.",

"You lost the capacity to receive in the spirit each time you go with the consciousness to receive the reward of your good deeds, what you will receive is a curse, because no one is qualified before God to receive the reward of his good deeds because no one have good deeds enough to qualify him to be blessed in the spirit, you can never please him without faith.",

"What qualifies you to receive the reward of your righteousness before God is 100% righteousness, someone who keep all the law and offended in one is like someone who didn't keep the law at all.",

`James 2:10
For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.`,

"May you not stand before God and be demanding for blessing because you are morally righteous you put yourself under high curse that is more than closed Heaven, because you lack the wisdom of receiving like Lazarus.",

"Each time you go to God to receive anything based on your good deeds, what you will receive is evil, just showing you mystery why Lazarus receive evil, even though you will still make it to Heaven because you are a seed of Abraham but you lack the wisdom to know that it is only by Faith that the children of Abraham can receive anything from God.",

`NKJV, Romans 4:14
For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect,`,

"So, do we have reward for been righteous? Yes, but the reward is what become gift for others, the reward of your righteousness is for those that accept you in the name of the righteous.",

"And there are many unrighteous rich people who understand the mystery of this, many of them are just enjoying the reward of the Righteous in their life and yet they are unrighteous, why many who are righteous are receiving the reward of the unrighteous because they lack the knowledge of this mystery.", 

"The scripture didn't say if you receive the righteous in the name of Christ, but he said if you receive the righteous in the name of the righteous, the reward of the righteous will surely follow you.",

"Look at the scripture again.",

`Matthew 10:41 
He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward. And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.`,

"He didn't say if you receive the prophet in the name of Christ, but if you receive the prophet in the name of the prophet, you shall receive the reward of the prophet.",

"Secondly, the scripture didn't say when you accept the righteous in the name of the righteous you will receive the reward of God, he said what you will receive is the reward of the righteous.",

"He didn't also said when you received the prophet in the name of the prophet you will receive the reward of God.",

"No sir, what you will receive is the reward of the prophet and what you will receive is the reward of the righteous.",

"Potiphar was able to understand this mystery and he never joke with Joseph, he knew the reason why God is blessing him is for the sake of Joseph.",

"Genesis 39:2 The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.",

"Genesis 39:5 So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the Lord was on all that he had in the house and in the field.",

"All the people in the potipher  house are not righteous, but the scripture say the lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake,",

"What potipher and every one in the house was receiving is the reward of Joseph, he was using the reward of Joseph to prosper and yet Joseph was still his slave.",

"The scripture never say and the lord was with Potiphar, the scripture say and the lord was with Joseph,",

"Genesis 39:2 The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.",

"Meaning, whosoever that house Joseph has house the Lord, meaning, such people is qualified to begin to enjoy the presence of God, not because they carry the presence of God but they receive someone that carry the presence of God.",

"There is a wisdom in Potiphar's heart that is missing in the rich man that house Lazarus.",

"Potiphar knows that God was blessing him for the sake of Joseph and he begin to promote Joseph, he doesn't want Joseph to leave.",

"Genesis 39:3 And his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all he did to prosper in his hand.",

"Genesis 39:4 So Joseph found favor in his sight, and served him. Then he made him overseer of his house, and all that he had he put under his authority.",

"But for the rich man, he become so rich based on the reward of Lazarus.",

"The scripture say when Lazarus died his angels Carried him, every righteous man has an angel guiding them, it was the angels of Lazarus making the rich man prospering.",

"There are many company that has employ a righteous man and the company is progressing because of the righteous man, literally speaking the righteous may not be productive in the place of work, but lack of discernment will make you not to know that his presence in your office is what is making everything to be productive.",

"At times you give them sack letter because they are not productive and since they left, their angels left with them, it is because you don't know how to receive the rewards of the righteous.",

"You don't know how to accept the righteous in the name of his righteousness, not in the name of his productivity, not in the name of his sharpness and his creativity in the place of work but in the name of his righteous and if you understand this mystery you will receive the reward of the righteous.",

"I write to you a mystery oh ye captain of industry, if your company survive unconsciously and you didn't involve in any ritual or diabolical things to make your company work, and the company is working, it is working on the strength of two things.",

"1. You are enjoying the reward of a prophet or you are enjoy the reward of a righteous man.",

"And the day you loose this wisdom of receiving that becomes the day your company begin to go down, it is spiritual, success is not hardworking, it is spiritual that only responds to spiritual code.",

"And the code is what I just released now.",

"Do you have any righteous in your place of work? May God give you Grace to know how to receive them in the name of the righteous, promote them not because they are productive but in the name of the righteous, show kindness to them not because they are physically bringing benefit to the organisation but they are spiritually bring strange blessings to that organisation.",

"If you can do this, you activate their angel to bless you more, this is the mystery of receiving the reward of the righteous.",

"Someone is asking how do I receive the reward of the prophet also? What is the reward of the prophet ?",

"The scripture say believe in the Lord and you shall be established and believe in the prophet and you shall prosper.",

`2 chronicles 20:20
................ Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.`,

"Many only believe in the lord but never believe in his prophet and that is why they are establish but are not prosper.",

"Meaning, prosperity lies in the mouth of the prophet.",

"If you know how to triger the spirit of prophet in them which is by gift, you will receive the reward of a prophet.",

"These are spiritual code of receiving, mind you God has blessed us already with all spiritual blessings, but I am giving you the wisdom of receiving those spiritual blessings.",

"Because you receive the spiritual blessing through Christ, but many didn't know Christ, they only know the invisible Christ, they don't know the visible image of the invisible Christ, and the visible image of the invisible Christ is the body of Christ.",

"It is through the body of Christ you receive every Grace, all Grace comes from God and God give all to us through Christ and we receive all from Christ through his BODY.",

"For instance If I want to give you something and you don't have relationship with my hand, you may not receive anything from me, because if I want to give anything I give it through my hand.",

"The moment you have Faith you don't look unto me again, begin to look at my hand, because it is through my hand you will receive.",

"Same to us, once you have received Faith to receive anything begin to look at the body of Christ, it is through the body of Christ that all blessing available in the Spirit will get to you.",

"And many unrighteous are tapping into this blessing than us, many of them have different men of God they are giving gift to but for you, all you do is to be claiming you are following his teachings.",

"You are following the teaching of a man of God for years and you have never honour him with gift even though it is little out of what you have, you are violating spiritual code.",

"That is why many Christians will die like Lazarus even though they will make it to Heaven.",

"Truly every giving must be based on leading, but the leading of the spirit is always based on the revelational light you have in you, so that when it Lead you to do something, you will do it from revelational understanding.",

"You will do it spiritually not religiously.",

"What is this prophet reward? Who are the prophet the scripture is talking about? How do the prophet released the reward.",

"And why must it be gift we use to trigger them to release the reward?.... it that scriptural?  Yes sir 100 percent scriptural.",

      "And this mind of God to interpret is the scripture, the old testament prophet spoke the mind of God, while the new testament prophets interprets the mind of God, and scripture is the mind of God.. May God deliver the body of christ from men with spirit of divination dragging themselves to be prophet.",

      "Matthew 6:2 Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward.",
      
      "That is why I pity men of God selling their grace and gift, that I don't sell my books for instance doesn't mean I don't like money, it is not self discipline but it is an expression of a mystery of reward I am sharing now. I lost my reward with God once I get my reward from man.",

      "Isaac was telling Esau here the code to trigger this dimension of blessing, you must do what makes me happy, it is not a blessing I release because I am high in the spirit after praying in tongue, it is a gift I release after I am high in soul with happiness (that is you trigger my emotion) you do what makes me happy.",
      
      "If the wife and biological children  of men of God can understand this, they should be the first to receive the reward of their husbands as wife and receive the reward of their father as children  but those that lose this reward most are those who allow over-familiarity to rub them off this strange supernatural blessing their man of God carry.",
      
      "This blessing has nothing to do with whether a man of God can raise the dead or not, it only has to do with if you are called by God and you obey the call.",
      
      "You must be wise enough to know how to trigger the emotions of men of God and this happen not when you just sow seed or give them gift, it happens when you give them gift that meet their needs, that is, you give them gift at the point of their need, gift that solve their needs, whatever they utter from their mouth by their emotions is their reward and men who understand this has tapped into it and become great in life with it.",
      
      "Ability to study the need of a man of God and meet him at the point of his need is what triggers them to release their reward.",
      
      "That is why this must either be done by the leading of the holy spirit because it is the holy spirit that knows their need or this is done by observations, you can literally look at a man of God and know his need.",
      
      "Whenever the Holy Spirit leads you to give into the life of a man of God , just know that the Holy Spirit is about to open you up into the blessing of the lord that makes men rich.",
      
      "Because the blessing of the Lord that make men rich is in the mouth of a man of God, that blessing of the Lord is their reward, many men of God has died with this because no body to trigger them to release it, and you see one unbeliever coming their way to just buy a car for them and suddenly they release the reward meant for their congregation on just one unbeliever who is not a member of the church.",
      
      "Over familiarity could only make you see the gift of a man of God but you cannot see his reward.",
      
      "Do you know I have been writing for years now and people are following and enjoying the gift.",
      
      "But do you know that for me to be writing for five years, it means I have a five years reward of my labour with God and one unbeliever can come and trigger my emotion and you see me releasing my five years of reward upon him, and yet you see those following my grace growing spiritually but not growing financially, ignorance will now make them to think that they need another man of God with grace of prosperity, they only just lack the knowledge of how to receive my reward.",
      
      "You don't know that once God gives you a man of God, everything your life needs both spiritually and materially is in the life of the man of God.",
      
      "You  need the grace and gift of that man of God to grow spiritually and you need his reward to grow financially, their reward is what the scripture describes as the blessing of the Lord making people rich without adding sorrow to it.",
      
      "Have you not observed that after some men of God have prayed  for you, they will just tell you by prophetic direction to give some man of God a gift, what they are saying is mystery just that they cannot explain it.",
      
      "May God give you wisdom to learn how to make a man of God bless you from their soul, not from their spirit, not from their pocket, but from their soul.",
      
      "What pains me most is that unbelievers are the ones enjoying our reward most, people who are not benefiting from our gift and ministerial grace are the ones benefiting from our reward.",
      
      "And the truth is that the reward is designed to be for our followers, for those benefiting from our spiritual gift, but ignorance of this mystery kept them behind. Spiritually they are growing because they are benefiting from our ministerial grace but financially they are not growing because they are not benefiting from our rewards.",

      I show you a code of the spirit...
      I show you a hidden wisdom of God....`,
