    title: "Making Peace With The Enemy.",
    content: [
      `I don't live a life of warfare because of the wisdom from the scripture that holy spirit taught me which I will be sharing in this diary.`,
      `It is wisdom of how to make peace with the enemy, this was the wisdom present in Solomon but was missing in David that made the life of David full of battle and made the life of Solomon to be free from battle.`,
      `1 Chronicles 22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. Look at what Solomon himself said about his father david;`,
      `1 Kings 5:3 You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the Lord his God because of the wars which were fought against him on every side, until the Lord put his foes under the soles of his feet.`,
      `1 Kings 5:4 But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence.
        The question is what is the wisdom behind a battle free life? It is the wisdom of learning how to make peace with your enemy.
        And we see Jesus giving this as a code in Luke 14:31 but many could not decode it. `,
      `Luke 14:31-32
        [31]“Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10,000 could defeat the 20,000 soldiers marching against him?
        [32]And if he can’t, he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away.`,
      `I don't know the interpretation you may give to this scripture, but there a deep revelational wisdom that Holy ghost taught me from it that is working for me.
        Many thought everything you do with the enemy is to make war with him, but many didn't know that there is wisdom in the Spirit to make peace with the enemy.`,
      `Get this mystery, every enemy you see in life that is still powerful attacking believers, the plan of God is for us to make peace with them and not make war with them.
        While the enemy that needed warfare which doesn't understand the language of peace are the enemy that Christ has come to deal with for us, those enemies you can't fight them, God himself have come down as Christ and fought them for us.`,
      `And he told us clearly in his word that over those enemy we are to hold our peace because he will fight for us.
        Exodus 14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
        He didn't say you should fight for yourself, he didn't say I will empower you to fight for yourself,  but he said I, God will fight for you, all you need to do is to fold your arms and enter your peace and rest.`,
      `He gave this as prophecy in Exodus and we see it coming to pass by Christ when God came as flesh to fight that enemy for us.
        Such enemies are called principalities, the scripture says Christ has put them in public shame for us.
        Colossians 2:15
        And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
        Every other enemy remaining, we are to make peace with them, that is why our weapons of warfare is not power, but wisdom, even the sword of the spirit is not fire, it is the word of God 
        God never told us to wrestle with demon or go in warfare with demon, he only told us to cast him out in the life of those not born again who are demon possessed, but if demon himself is coming for you, facing and fighting them will cause you many unrest in life, there are hidden wisdom available for us to make peace with demon .( just open your mind and be following).
        Have you come across scripture that define wisdom as the greatest weapon of warfare?
        Ecclesiastes 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war;`,
      `Ecclesiastes 9:18(NLT)
        [18]Better to have wisdom than weapons of war, 
        What is God saying to us in this scripture that we don't pay due attention to?
        To you power should be the greatest weapon of warfare,  so you are busy crying for power, but God is saying better to have wisdom than all weapon of warfare. 
        When you hold wisdom in your hand as weapon of warfare, it is not to attack the enemy but to make peace with the enemy so as to let you go. Have you observed that in most cases if God gives you power, it is to solve people's problems minus your own problems?`,
      `Go back to the book of God's generals and see how mighty men fell at the feet of the enemy with their power, due to some decision not guided with wisdom that they took, 
        have you observed that highest percentage of the books of God's generals never ended well, many of us only read their miraculous story but we never paid attention to their ending. 
        For David, God taught his hands to war and that is the picture of Christ but for Solomon, God taught him to make peace with the enemy and that is the picture of the church.
        That is why the scripture keep on calling us more than a conqueror but yet we cannot understand the meaning.`,
        `Romans 8:37
        Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
        We still carry the mentality of warfare, which is fighting to conquer, but the scripture keep on calling us more than conquerors.
        A conqueror is the person that fight his enemy and win by power.
        While more than conqueror is the person that have the skills and wisdom to settle with his enemy and they are living in peace, God now begin to prepare a table before him in the presence of his enemy. `,
      `God's plan is for the wheat and the tares to grow together,  but we want to be separating them and fighting the tares.( Mathew 13:25:30)
        I don't know the enemy you have, be it the enemy of your health which is sickness, enemy of your finance which is poverty, enemy of your progress which is stagnation, enemy of your rest which is frustration, all these enemies are spirit, there are wisdom in the spirit that can make you to make peace with them, and they will effortlessly leave you alone permanently. `,
      `Infact, God is taking something relating to this for us in the scripture but we aren't getting the code, he said I will make your enemy to be at peace with you.
        Proverbs 16:7 When a man’s ways please the Lord,
        He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
        He didn't say I will kill your enemy for you, he didn't say I will fight your enemy for you, but he said I will make them to be at peace with you.`,
      `Take note of these two scriptures;`,
      `1. Proverbs 16:7 where God said I will make your enemy to be at peace with you. 
        2. Exodus 14:14 where God is saying I will fight for you.
        There are two enemy we must pay attention to that we have. 
        The first one is the enemy that God came to fight for us.
        The second enemy God didn't come to fight them for us, he came to make them to be at peace with us.
        There are enemy that God fight for us, and we see Jesus coming to deal with that, any enemy you are fighting now, it is a lack of your revelational knowledge of your position in Christ.
        While the second enemy, God didn't deal with them at the cross, they are the enemy the scripture talk about when he told Jesus "sit at my right hand until I make all your enemy to be under your foot"`,
      `Matthew 22:44 ‘The Lord said to my Lord,
        “Sit at My right hand,
        Till I make Your enemies Your footstool”’?
        Meaning not all the enemy have been conquered yet.
        Meaning there are some enemy that aren't yet under the feet of Jesus, this enemy, we don't fight them by fire, they don't die by fire, trying to attack them put you more in trouble, that is why many warfare churches never enter their rest, it is battle always and yet those enemies never die, the more they pray and do warfare prayer, the more the enemy wage war against them.`,
      `Have you observed that many of our mothers have been fighting this battle in praying vigil for over 20 years and yet they handed over the same pattern to us and we never questioned it that something is wrong with this warfare prayer.
        What is this battle we are fighting for over 20 years with prayer and yet never solve, is that battle powerful more than the name of Jesus, is God no longer on the throne?
        A wisdom is only missing in us, people are perishing not because they don't pray but because they lack revelational knowledge. `,
        `They don't know that there are two enemy, the first one which Christ has dealt with for us and he has put them in open shame, while the second are the enemy not yet under the foot of jesus and this enemy you dont fight them, you make peace with them.
        Look at the parable Jesus gave on how to handle this kind of enemy.
        Luke 14:31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?`,
      `Luke 14:32 Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.
        Take note of the first bible verse, 
        This is a battle between two kings.
        You are a king, the enemies also are kings.
        And the scripture say when the first king noticed that the weapon of his enemy is more than his own, he quickly sent delegates to his enemy and make peace with him.
        There are enemy that God want you to handle like that.`,
      `I know you are full of fire, but I tell you, calm down, if all your life is full of battle, you can never make progress in life, infact you can't be a tool in building God's church,  such is the case of David.
        If all your life is about battles then where is the place of rest that God promised us ? 
        You can't be wiser than the scripture that say wisdom is better than all weapons of war.
        This scripture is a promise you can claim it, and free yourself from all this warfare mentality,  they are stronghold you need to be free from. `,
      `Can you claim this scripture for yourself and put your name in it ..and see how life in Christ can be full of peace and rest. 
        1 Chronicles 22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be BANJO AYEKA, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.`,
      `The question is how can I make peace with my enemy?
        Let us journey again by tomorrow, it is a 365 days journey in the spirit, you will see how your spiritual life will shift and grow within one year.`,

    title: "Negotiating With The Enemy.",
    content: [
      `Have you sat down to ask yourself how Jesus overcame the enemy for us? By warfare and fighting the devil ? No sir, it was by making peace with the enemy on our behalf.`,
      `That is, they entered into negotiation at the conference house of immortality and ask the devil to name his price for him to release us.`,
      `The scripture says we were bought by the blood of Jesus. `,
      `1 Corinthians 6:20 For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.`,
      `Bought from who and bought by who? Bought from the devil and by Christ.

      If you want to buy something from someone, you don't first determine how much you want to pay, the seller determines how much he want to sell, then because of how much you love what you want to buy or redeem, you then enter into peaceful negotiation with the seller.`,
      `This is what the scripture describes as redemption.

      Redemption means (apolutrósis) and it's a situation whereby Christ purchases us, he ransomed us, with the price of his own life, securing our deliverance from the bondage.`,
      `That word “redeem” is a language of the marketplace in both the Greek and the Roman cultures in Paul’s day.

      The question is who did Jesus bought us from ? Jesus didn't buy us from God, he bought us from the devil, meaning, it wasn't God that demanded the life of Jesus, it was the devil that demanded for the life of Jesus as price before he could release us.`,
      `And  Christ didn't ask devil to die by fire but he paid the price for our release, he never hijacked us from the enemy by his powers through warfare but he released us with his life  through negotiation.

      What is the mystery of negotiating with the enemy that many of us don't understand?
      
      You may ask why did devil demand for Jesus in our place and in exchange of us? it was because devil knows that if he can have Jesus he already have everything.`,
      `Do you remember when he was asking Jesus to bow down for him in exchange of the whole world, they are talking business here, you are busy talking warfare, buying and selling is warfare in the spirit, market place is a battle field, devil mean business here when he was asking Jesus to bow so he'll give Jesus the whole world and it's Glory.`,
      `Luke 4:5 Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.`,
      `Luke 4:6 And the devil said to Him, “All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.`,
      `Luke 4:7 Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours.”`,
      `Because he want Jesus and he prefer to have Jesus under him than having the whole world under him, so he threw his negotiation to Jesus.

      But what Jesus need was not the world and it's glory, there is something in the hand of the devil that Jesus also need, and that is our souls, our souls are in the hand of the devil and Jesus also desire to have it, and Jesus ask him to name his price.`,
      `And he demanded for the life of Jesus in exchange for our life, in his own wisdom he felt once he can have Jesus he have everything, because he knew by Jesus everything both in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible was created, and Jesus surrendered his life to him in exchange of our life.

      You can see peaceful negotiation in the Spirit realm. This is the All-Powerful God, what is God trying to do here that we didn't understand ? this is what Paul referred to as the foolishness of God.`,
      `1 Corinthians 1:25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.`,
      `Because how can you refuse to hijack your people whom you love from the hand of the enemy when you have the power but rather go for negotiation with the enemy. That sound foolish in the realm of man that felt life is by force, but that is wisdom in the realm of God where they know that life is by talk (word).
      Is devil so important like that for God to go on negotiating with him before he released us? Devil is not as important as that.`,
      `But there is a wisdom of warfare that many never understood, all we know is to fight the enemy by facing the enemy, we fight spirit as if we are fighting flesh and blood.

      We get angry at spirit the way we get angry at humans beings, we call it holy anger, and devil keep on laughing at us because he knows that anger rest in the bosom of fools.`,
      `Ecclesiastes 7:9 Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry, For anger rests in the bosom of fools.`,
      `Whenever God want to get angry at his enemy he laughs, that is why the scripture says he that sitted in heavens shall laugh.`,
      `Psalms 2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves,
      And the rulers take counsel together,
      Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying,
      
      Psalms 2:3 “Let us break Their bonds in pieces
      And cast away Their cords from us.”
      
      Psalms 2:4 He who sits in the heavens shall laugh;The Lord shall hold them in derision.`,

      `Take note of verse 4 to see the reaction of God to the enemy.
      "He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision."
      
      The way God expresses anger to spirit which are invisible creature is different from the way God expresses anger to men which are visible creatures.
      
      If you can't fight spirit the way God is fighting them, then you don't understand spiritual warfare yet.`,
      `The highest level of warfare in the spirit is negotiation. A situation whereby you ask the enemy to name the price and give him what he wants.

      Any country who adopt this principle end up becomimg a peaceful nation, it is a law of the spirit.
      
      There was a time the militants were disturbing the south south region of the nation Nigeria, everyone was advising the then president to raise warfare with them, because he is the commander in the chief of Armed forces, but the president was so wise enough to understand the code of the spirit, he called them into negotiation and asked them to name their price and they entered into agreement and that became the end of war. He make peace with the enemy.`,
      `This was also what Christ did with the enemy. 

      The question is why didn't Jesus hijack us from the devil, why does he have to stoop so low to the level of buying when all power and authority to hijack us is in his hands? 
      
      Because our weapon of warfare in the body of Christ today is far from the way Jesus did his own warfare and we claim he is the one we are looking unto as the author and finisher of our faith.`,

      `But we see Jesus negotiating with the devil here asking him to name his price, and giving the devil the cost of the price of our soul.

      I tell you a mystery today that you can negotiate with sickness,  poverty,  backwardness, and they will eternally leave you alone, they will eternally make peace with you, just be following this devotionals.`,
      `The word redeem means to buy back, Jesus didn't enter into the gate of hell and hades to hijack us by warfare, he went on negotiation at the round table to seek for their price, negotiate it with them and trasfer the price to the bank account of the devil and when the devil saw the alert, he released us all. 

      This sound to be downgrading the integrity of the Almighty, negotiating with ordinary so called Satan, but it is a mystery of warfare many doesn't understand, it is not reconciling with the enemy, it is making peace with the enemy for a purpose which you will see as you read this teaching.`,
      `Many of us are fighting like angels who go on warfare with the devil rather than we fighting like Jesus, who goes on negotiations with the devil. 

      This now makes us begin to quote the book of revelation out of context where the scripture says that there was war in heaven, we felt there must also be war on Earth.`,
      `Revelation 12:7 Satan Thrown Out of Heaven
      And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,
      
      Revelation 12:8 but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer.
      Revelation 12:9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.`,
      `There is no wisdom in the method of warfare between the Angel and devil in the heavenly places stated in this scripture, but we don't pay spiritual attention to it.

      The scripture says when an angel prevailed over the devil with warfare, he sent satan to Earth. `,
      `Revelation 12:9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.`,
      `Was it Earth he suppose to cast Satan to or hell? 

      It is like one enemy came to fight you and claim you defeated him but only for you to send him out of your room but send him to the room of the children of your boss, truly you are free but the children of your boss are now in danger. 
      
      You only fought for your life, but never considered the children of your master, such was what Micheal did.`,
      `No one go into warfare with the enemy and not loose something ,truly you may win someone, but you will lose something, there is always side effect of every warfare and many of us didn't know this, and we saw the side effect of the warfare Angel Michael did with the devil here now.

      Angels are servant of God, why we are predestined sons of God, and Micheal in his warfare now sent Satan out of the realm of the servants of God (Angels) and cast him to the realm of we whom God is mindful of.`,
      `Can I call this jealousy, when you know that God is mindful of men.`,
      `Psalms 8:4 What is man that You are mindful of him,And the son of man that You visit him?

      Psalms 8:5 For You have made him a little lower than the angels,
      And You have crowned him with glory and honor.
      
      Psalms 8:6 You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands;
      You have put all things under his feet,`,
      `Why will Angel Micheal cast the devil to Earth rather than casting him to hell, when he knows that Earth is the habitant of the creature that God love most, which is man.

      Our suffering on Earth today now was the negative effect of the victory of Angel Micheal with the devil in the heavenly places. There is no wisdom in such warfare but we didn't know, they now have peace in Heaven because devil is no longer there but woe unto the Earth for devil has been sent to you. `,
      `Revelation 12:12 Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.”`,
      `Why will angel Micheal be so selfish like that, Heaven is not our place, what the scripture says is that the Earth he has given to the children of man, Earth is our habitat.`,
      `Psalms 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s;
      But the Earth He has given to the children of men.`,
      `Infact, after rapture we are not going to Heaven, Heaven is not our home, we are going to a new Earth. `,
      `Revelation 21:1 All Things Made New
      Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea.`,
      `So Earth is what is designed for the children of God and that same Earth is designed to be the habitant of God's children,  the servant of God called Micheal now cast Satan to that same environment of the children of God just because he wanted the environment of the servant of God which are the angels to be peaceful. 

      The sons of God are now in woes, while the servants of God who are the angels are now enjoying.`,
      `NKJV, Revelation 12:12
      Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.”`,
      `That is why Solomon by the help of the Spirit said he has seen something under heaven that the princes who are the sons of God are struggling on earth while the servants who are the angels are riding on chariot of horses.`,
      `Ecclesiastes 10:7 I have seen servants on horses, While princes walk on the ground like servants.`,
      `Each time men in the scripture capture the picture of angels in their vision, you see them on chariots or horses, that is their reality, and they are servants, but many princes of the king which are the children of God are struggling on Earth. 

      Many of us blame Adam that through him, sin entered into the Earth, but we didn't know that the problem was through the warfare method of Angel Micheal who sent Satan to the Earth rather than sending him to hell. `,
      `Truly by Adam sin came into the Earth, but I tell you that by Angel Micheal Satan came into the Earth. 

      Hell was the place God prepared for Satan not Earth, that is why the scripture now said that another angel now come in revelation 20 and cast Satan from Earth to the bottomless pit.`,
      `Revelation 20:1 
      Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
      
      Revelation 20:2 He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;
      
      Revelation 20:3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while.`,
      `If Micheal fought with wisdom, this is what he could have done, that is he could have sent him to hell and not to Earth.

      Someone is saying how will you be talking to a whole angel Micheal like this.`,
      `Please don't think I am trying to be rude to angel Micheal, I am only tapping into the wisdom of the world to come by which we'll posses to judge Angels, because just as we have the power of the world to come so also we have the wisdom of the world to come, and men who can tap into the wisdom of the world to come will understand what I am saying. 

      There are many of the angelic activities that finds expression both in Heaven and on Earth which we have given accolades to which we're going to judge on the last day. The scripture told us clearly that we shall judge angels.`,
      `1 Corinthians 6:3 Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?`,
      `I love the way amplified version puts it.`,
      `1cor 6:3
      3 Do you not know also that we [Christians] are to judge the [very] angels and pronounce opinion between right and wrong [for them]? How much more then [as to] matters pertaining to this world and of this life only!`,
      `The scripture is not talking about falling angels here, it is talking about Holy angels.

      We are not judging falling Angels because they have been judged already, but we are going to judge Holy angels because they are not also perfect in their act and deed, and one of it is what i am revealing now by the wisdom of the world to come.
      
      The scripture say angels are not Holy also in the sight of God `,
      `Job 15
      15 Behold, [God] puts no trust in His holy ones [the angels]; indeed, the heavens are not clean in His sight--( Amplified version)`,
      `Meaning, there are certain act of imperfections Angels are  expressing which many didn't know, the fearful honour we have for them make us to think they are perfect, they are holy but they are not perfect.

      And one of their imperfection  is what I am expressing to you now which Angel Michael did.
      
      We are going to judge the rights and wrongs of Angels.`,
      `We  look at angels with fear  because we don't know our identity and they are also looking at us with fear because they know our identity, they know they are servants of God and they know we are sons of God, they know we're the one that will judge them.

      We see them as servants of God and they see us as the children of their master and their judge.`,
      `They are designed to be mighty in strength than us because of their assignment for us why we are designed to be wiser than them because of our position in Christ.

      That is why the scripture say the manifold wisdom of God is designed to be made known by the church to the angels.`,
      `Ephesians 3:
      10 [The purpose is] that through the church the [c]complicated, many-sided wisdom of God in all its infinite variety and innumerable aspects might now be made known to the angelic rulers and authorities (principalities and powers) in the heavenly sphere.`,
      `I tell you today that men are not the only one reading this teaching, Angels are also reading to learn from it.

      So if I am trying to bring corrections to what Angels did, don't think I am speaking heresy, i know the realm at which i am talking from.
      
      Just saying this for you to know that the method of warfare of Angel Micheal is not given to us by God to copy, we are not to learn from that, it is not a perfect method of warfare, 
      the method through which Christ put captivity into captive and give gift to men is the method we are to follow.`,
      `And that is the principle of negotiations, the principles of making peace with the enemy. 

      Now the question is how can I negotiate with the devil, how can I make peace with the enemy? How can my enemy also be at peace with me? How can I also adopt this wisdom over sickness, poverty, or any of your enemy?
      
      Just be following, at night devotion, you will see the wisdom from the scripture and you will see how a man can be eternally free from battle of life `

    content:[
      `I said in the last page that the method of warfare of angel Micheal with the devil is not something to study and emulate, but to study it and by the hidden  wisdom of God manifesting in us we bring judgement and corrections to it, because one of our assignment in the world to come is that we are going to analyse all the activities of Angels recoded in the scripture which we celebrate now and begin to bring corrections and judgement to them.`,
      
      `1 Corinthians 6
      3 Do you not know also that we [Christians] are to judge the [very] angels and pronounce opinion between right and wrong [for them]? How much more then [as to] matters pertaining to this world and of this life only!`,
      `So when the scripture begin  reveal the method of warfare of Angel Micheal with the devil, there's nothing to emulate about.`,

      `And that is why the scripture begin to quickly give us the method we are to use in that same bible verse, that we overcome him not by warfare but by the blood of the lamb, not by fighting but by the word of our testimony which is telling devil what Christ has done for us, not telling God what devil is doing, but telling devil what Christ has done and also because we are not afraid to lose our life.`
