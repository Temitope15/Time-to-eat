    content: [
      `I don't live a life of warfare because of the wisdom from the scripture that holy spirit taught me which I will be sharing in this diary.`,
      `It is wisdom of how to make peace with the enemy, this was the wisdom present in Solomon but was missing in David that made the life of David full of battle and made the life of Solomon to be free from battle.`,
      `1 Chronicles 22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. Look at what Solomon himself said about his father david;`,
      `1 Kings 5:3 You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the Lord his God because of the wars which were fought against him on every side, until the Lord put his foes under the soles of his feet.`,
      `1 Kings 5:4 But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence.
        The question is what is the wisdom behind a battle free life? It is the wisdom of learning how to make peace with your enemy.
        And we see Jesus giving this as a code in Luke 14:31 but many could not decode it. `,
      `Luke 14:31-32
        [31]“Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10,000 could defeat the 20,000 soldiers marching against him?
        [32]And if he can’t, he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away.`,
      `I don't know the interpretation you may give to this scripture, but there a deep revelational wisdom that Holy ghost taught me from it that is working for me.
        Many thought everything you do with the enemy is to make war with him, but many didn't know that there is wisdom in the Spirit to make peace with the enemy.`,
      `Get this mystery, every enemy you see in life that is still powerful attacking believers, the plan of God is for us to make peace with them and not make war with them.
        While the enemy that needed warfare which doesn't understand the language of peace are the enemy that Christ has come to deal with for us, those enemies you can't fight them, God himself have come down as Christ and fought them for us.`,
      `And he told us clearly in his word that over those enemy we are to hold our peace because he will fight for us.
        Exodus 14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
        He didn't say you should fight for yourself, he didn't say I will empower you to fight for yourself,  but he said I, God will fight for you, all you need to do is to fold your arms and enter your peace and rest.`,
      `He gave this as prophecy in Exodus and we see it coming to pass by Christ when God came as flesh to fight that enemy for us.
        Such enemies are called principalities, the scripture says Christ has put them in public shame for us.
        Colossians 2:15
        And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
        Every other enemy remaining, we are to make peace with them, that is why our weapons of warfare is not power, but wisdom, even the sword of the spirit is not fire, it is the word of God 
        God never told us to wrestle with demon or go in warfare with demon, he only told us to cast him out in the life of those not born again who are demon possessed, but if demon himself is coming for you, facing and fighting them will cause you many unrest in life, there are hidden wisdom available for us to make peace with demon .( just open your mind and be following).
        Have you come across scripture that define wisdom as the greatest weapon of warfare?
        Ecclesiastes 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war;`,
      `Ecclesiastes 9:18(NLT)
        [18]Better to have wisdom than weapons of war, 
        What is God saying to us in this scripture that we don't pay due attention to?
        To you power should be the greatest weapon of warfare,  so you are busy crying for power, but God is saying better to have wisdom than all weapon of warfare. 
        When you hold wisdom in your hand as weapon of warfare, it is not to attack the enemy but to make peace with the enemy so as to let you go. Have you observed that in most cases if God gives you power, it is to solve people's problems minus your own problems?`,
      `Go back to the book of God's generals and see how mighty men fell at the feet of the enemy with their power, due to some decision not guided with wisdom that they took, 
        have you observed that highest percentage of the books of God's generals never ended well, many of us only read their miraculous story but we never paid attention to their ending. 
        For David, God taught his hands to war and that is the picture of Christ but for Solomon, God taught him to make peace with the enemy and that is the picture of the church.
        That is why the scripture keep on calling us more than a conqueror but yet we cannot understand the meaning.`,
        `Romans 8:37
        Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
        We still carry the mentality of warfare, which is fighting to conquer, but the scripture keep on calling us more than conquerors.
        A conqueror is the person that fight his enemy and win by power.
        While more than conqueror is the person that have the skills and wisdom to settle with his enemy and they are living in peace, God now begin to prepare a table before him in the presence of his enemy. `,
      `God's plan is for the wheat and the tares to grow together,  but we want to be separating them and fighting the tares.( Mathew 13:25:30)
        I don't know the enemy you have, be it the enemy of your health which is sickness, enemy of your finance which is poverty, enemy of your progress which is stagnation, enemy of your rest which is frustration, all these enemies are spirit, there are wisdom in the spirit that can make you to make peace with them, and they will effortlessly leave you alone permanently. `,
      `Infact, God is taking something relating to this for us in the scripture but we aren't getting the code, he said I will make your enemy to be at peace with you.
        Proverbs 16:7 When a man’s ways please the Lord,
        He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
        He didn't say I will kill your enemy for you, he didn't say I will fight your enemy for you, but he said I will make them to be at peace with you.`,
      `Take note of these two scriptures;`,
      `1. Proverbs 16:7 where God said I will make your enemy to be at peace with you. 
        2. Exodus 14:14 where God is saying I will fight for you.
        There are two enemy we must pay attention to that we have. 
        The first one is the enemy that God came to fight for us.
        The second enemy God didn't come to fight them for us, he came to make them to be at peace with us.
        There are enemy that God fight for us, and we see Jesus coming to deal with that, any enemy you are fighting now, it is a lack of your revelational knowledge of your position in Christ.
        While the second enemy, God didn't deal with them at the cross, they are the enemy the scripture talk about when he told Jesus "sit at my right hand until I make all your enemy to be under your foot"`,
      `Matthew 22:44 ‘The Lord said to my Lord,
        “Sit at My right hand,
        Till I make Your enemies Your footstool”’?
        Meaning not all the enemy have been conquered yet.
        Meaning there are some enemy that aren't yet under the feet of Jesus, this enemy, we don't fight them by fire, they don't die by fire, trying to attack them put you more in trouble, that is why many warfare churches never enter their rest, it is battle always and yet those enemies never die, the more they pray and do warfare prayer, the more the enemy wage war against them.`,
      `Have you observed that many of our mothers have been fighting this battle in praying vigil for over 20 years and yet they handed over the same pattern to us and we never questioned it that something is wrong with this warfare prayer.
        What is this battle we are fighting for over 20 years with prayer and yet never solve, is that battle powerful more than the name of Jesus, is God no longer on the throne?
        A wisdom is only missing in us, people are perishing not because they don't pray but because they lack revelational knowledge. `,
        `They don't know that there are two enemy, the first one which Christ has dealt with for us and he has put them in open shame, while the second are the enemy not yet under the foot of jesus and this enemy you dont fight them, you make peace with them.
        Look at the parable Jesus gave on how to handle this kind of enemy.
        Luke 14:31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?`,
      `Luke 14:32 Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.
        Take note of the first bible verse, 
        This is a battle between two kings.
        You are a king, the enemies also are kings.
        And the scripture say when the first king noticed that the weapon of his enemy is more than his own, he quickly sent delegates to his enemy and make peace with him.
        There are enemy that God want you to handle like that.`,
      `I know you are full of fire, but I tell you, calm down, if all your life is full of battle, you can never make progress in life, infact you can't be a tool in building God's church,  such is the case of David.
        If all your life is about battles then where is the place of rest that God promised us ? 
        You can't be wiser than the scripture that say wisdom is better than all weapons of war.
        This scripture is a promise you can claim it, and free yourself from all this warfare mentality,  they are stronghold you need to be free from. `,
      `Can you claim this scripture for yourself and put your name in it ..and see how life in Christ can be full of peace and rest. 
        1 Chronicles 22:9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be BANJO AYEKA, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.`,
      `The question is how can I make peace with my enemy?
        Let us journey again by tomorrow, it is a 365 days journey in the spirit, you will see how your spiritual life will shift and grow within one year.`,
